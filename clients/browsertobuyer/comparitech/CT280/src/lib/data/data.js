          <p>Auvik is designed for <b>remote system monitoring</b> – even your home network is remote to the processes on the Auvik servers. Network monitoring works on a system of thresholds. The service tracks a list of metrics on network activity and a threshold for resource usage or system performance is added to each of these conditions. If that <b>threshold level</b> is passed, the Auvik service will generate <b>an alert</b>. This means that your team of technicians doesn’t need to pay attention to the network unless a problem arises.</p>
          <p>The Auvik service can be expanded through the use of third-party tools for which the network monitor has <b>integrations</b>. There are two plan levels for Auvik – Essential and Performance. The Performance plan is the higher plan and it offers <b>traffic analysis</b> functions and <b>Syslog management</b> on top of the network monitoring services that are available in the Essentials plan.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>I feel that multi-site businesses would benefit most from the Auvik service. This network monitoring package enables you to centralize system management in one location.</p>

            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p><b>Paessler PRTG</b> is a very flexible service. You can choose which sensors to turn on and create your own tailored monitoring system for networks, servers, and applications.</p>
            <p>I was impressed with the great visualization, the tool has a <b>customizable dashboard </b>that allowed me to produce <b>real-time network maps</b> of our infrastructure. You can create maps with the drag-and-drop editor and use <b>over 300 map objects </b>to build the map. You can even create your own map objects with custom HTML.</p>
            <p>The<b> threshold-based alerts system </b>keeps you updated if the status of a sensor changes, a value changes or a threshold is breached. <b>Notifications</b> are available in a variety of formats including <b>email, push notification, SMS, Slack message, Syslog message, SNMP trap, HTTP action, execute program,</b> and more.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>The comprehensive nature of PRTG provides extensive monitoring for all categories of IT systems, which makes this a good choice for large organizations. However, the free option, which is limited to 100 sensors, is very appealing to small businesses.</p>

            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p>This cloud-based system can be accessed through any standard Web browser and it can monitor multiple sites simultaneously. Once we were granted access to a site, the autodiscovery feature of <b>Domotz</b> compiled and maintained an inventory and network map.</p>
            <p>The Domotz package has a large number of features. The tool is centered on network monitoring via <b>SNMP</b> and other network protocols. This includes the possibility to easily configure SNMP sensors and alerts. You can also specify your own alert conditions.</p>
            <p>SNMP reports enable the system to compile an <b>asset inventory</b> and draw up a <b>network map</b>. These services are updated with every SNMP agent response cycle. The information attached to each node in the map and the inventory list details the make and model of each divide and its capacity.</p>
            <p>The package also includes a switch port mapper, and management tools within the package allow the remote access and configuration management of network devices. <b>IoT services</b> can also be accessed and controlled remotely. The system is able to cross network platforms to access wireless networks and devices, through hundreds of integrations and the possibility of implementing customized monitoring drivers.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>Domotz offers a multi-tenanted version that is a good fit for use by managed service providers. In-house operations teams could also use this system for multi-site monitoring.</p>
            <p>There are two pricing plans for Domotz.The <strong>Device Plan</strong> costs up to $1.50 per month per device,and their <strong>Location Plan</strong> is priced at $35 or less per month, per location.

              <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
              <p><b>Checkmk Raw</b> is a fantastic system monitoring package for free. This system covers wireless networks as well as LANs and it will track traffic patterns along with network device statuses.</p>
              <p>On testing, this network monitoring system started its service by searching the network and identifying all connected devices. The package compiled <b>a device inventory</b> from the results of this search and the resultant list of equipment formed the basis of the network monitoring dashboard’s status reports. The package also created <b>a live network map</b>.</p>
              <p>The base package of Checkmk is completely <b>free to use</b>. There is also a paid version of the system, called <b>Checkmk Enterprise</b>, which has an edition that caters to managed service providers.</p>
              <p>As a free tool, the basic service is very attractive to small businesses and companies on a tight budget. The monitor queries switches, routers, and firewalls through the <b>SNMP</b> system. All of your network devices will already have SNMP agents installed on them but that function might need to be enabled. The Checkmk software polls agents for status reports. The responses get compiled into <b>live reports</b> on network readiness and capacity performance.</p>
              <p>The dashboard allows network managers to get <b>an overview</b> of all activity and then has a number of options to drill down through to reports on individual devices both live and over time. The Checkmk package also offers <b>bandwidth monitoring</b>, which gives you indicators on where device and cable capacity is not enough to cope with demand.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>The Checkmk Raw system is an ideal solution for small businesses and startups that are operating tight cost controls. The device-based option for the paid Checkmk Enterprise keeps servers free for application hosting.</p>
              <p>The paid version of Checkmk is priced on a sliding scale based on the number of hosts that are on the monitored network. Access the free version, which is called Checkmk Raw to assess the package. Both Checkmk Raw and Checkmk Enterprise run on Linux. The Enterprise edition can also be bought on a physical appliance.

            <p>You can drill down to the device’s IP address and file level</p>
            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p><b>NinjaOne RMM</b> optimizes the productivity of your IT support technicians. Alerts in the package mean that no one needs to sit and watch the activity on each remote site because the technical team will be notified if a problem arises. The system checks for network device availability and tracks traffic throughput volumes.</p>
            <p>When an MSP has a new client to monitor, a technician needs to install a NinjaOne <b>agent</b> on a computer connected to the remote network. This agent sends out requests for network service status reports and then forwards the received data to the NinjaOne server.</p>
            <p>Those device reports reveal what equipment is on the network. On testing, NinjaOne RMM compiled a <b>hardware inventory</b> from that information. As well as reference information, the tool brought back live device activity data, which it displayed in the dashboard. Those reports contain more data sets than the console can display and we got the opportunity to <b>customize</b> the dashboard to choose the metrics that you believe are important.</p>
            <p>Each of the gathered statistics can have performance thresholds placed on them and when these levels are crossed, the system triggers an alert. The RMM also collects traffic through data using the <b>NetFlow</b>, <b>J-Flow</b>, <b>sFlow</b>, and <b>IPFIX</b> protocols. These statistics can also have alert thresholds placed on them.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>The NinjaOne RMM is designed for use by managed service providers. However, there is nothing to stop IT departments from using the platform for in-house monitoring. We found that the tool can monitor multiple sites simultaneously and it also includes endpoint monitoring and management systems, such as a patch manager.</p>
            <p>G2’s 11-time consecutive acknowledgment placed NinjaOne atop in RMM, Patch Management, and Endpoint Management. You can get a custom quote for NinjaOne based on your needs.

            <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
            <p><b>Progress WhatsUp Gold</b> provides detailed, customizable dashboards that give users the ability to track the health of the entire network at a glance. It allows for granular reporting and alerts, which help teams stay proactive by notifying them of potential problems such as device outages or performance degradation.</p>
            <p>The base package of WhatsUp Gold sets itself up through an autodiscovery process. This documents and maps all devices and then immediately starts continuous monitoring. The service is highly automated and users won’t need to pay attention to the console unless a problem arises. The tool will raise an alert and send out a notification when technicians are needed.</p>
            <p>Once that core unit is operational, buyers can consider the other units that Progres offers. These other modules plug into the core console and add on monitoring for network traffic, servers, applications, and virtual systems.</p>
            <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
            <p>This package is ideal for network administrators and IT professionals in businesses of all sizes, offering comprehensive network monitoring, real-time issue detection, and customizable dashboards. It suits organizations with complex, multi-site infrastructures, providing proactive monitoring, automated alerts, detailed reporting, and third-party integrations for efficient IT management.</p>
            <p>Progress WhatsUp Gold runs on Windows Server and I found it very easy to install and use.

          <p>An intuitive visualization of server loads</p>
          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p>The <b>ManageEngine OpManager</b> system is one of the few detailed network monitoring systems that offers a graphical user interface for Linux. While most Linux network monitors are command-line systems, the high-quality graphs and charts of OpManager make status recognition easy.</p>
          <p><b>SNMP monitoring</b> keeps you updated on the performance of devices within your network. For increased visibility, you can use the<b> network mapping </b>feature to <b>automatically discover and map </b>new devices. You can schedule network discovery to find new devices once they’re added to your network.</p>
          <p>We tested the alerts system which helps you to respond to performance changes quickly. It worked flawlessly. ManageEngine OpManager correlates network events and only presents relevant alerts to the user while minimizing false positives. The program sends alerts by<b> email </b>and<b> SMS</b> to keep you updated on any emerging problems.</p>
          <p>ManageEngine OpManager is an all-in-one network monitor that is recommended for users that want a simple infrastructure monitoring tool.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>This software package installs on Linux, Windows Server, Azure, and AWS. Although it works well on all these platforms, of all the network monitoring systems designed to run on Linux, ManageEngine OpManager is considered to be the best option.</p>
          <p>ManageEngine OpManager is an all-in-one network monitor that is recommended for users that want a simple infrastructure monitoring tool.

              <p>The RMM includes a <b>summary</b> of all devices on the network and each entry in this list provides a link through to a details screen. The service provides automated monitoring because it will raise an alert if the network scanner identifies a problem with a network device. This means that technicians don’t have to watch the monitoring console to wait for problems.</p>
              <p>The RMM is designed to enable one MSP technician to look after the system of multiple businesses. This <b>efficiency</b> is essential because it is the key feature that enables MSPs to undercut in-house IT departments and encourage companies to outsource their IT asset management.</p>
              <p>The network monitoring service doesn’t just track switches, routers, and firewalls; it also lists <b>endpoints</b>, such as servers and workstations. The network monitoring service forms the basis for endpoint management features that include software license management and patching.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>The SuperOps system is ideal for managed service providers. MSPs will be likely to take one of the combined packages that include both RMM and PSA systems. However, SuperOps also offers an RMM-only bundle. This edition is suitable for use by IT departments who need the system support tools in the RMM system but not the MSP management software that the PSA provides.</p>
              <p>SuperOps is available in four editions: <b>RMM only</b>, <b>PSA only</b>, <b>Pro</b> Unified Basic, and <b>Super</b> Unified Advanced.

          <p>A summary view of a device’s characteristics and status</p>
          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p>The <b>Site24x7 Network Monitoring</b> service is bundled in with other monitors for servers, applications, and Web assets. You choose which services to track and set up performance thresholds that trigger alerts.</p>
          <p>The autodiscovery feature of Site24x7 is driven by the <b>Simple Network Management Protocol</b> <b>(SNMP)</b>. This system is built into all network devices. It just needs an SNMP manager to request status information from the agent software that is loaded onto every switch and router by their manufacturers. Site24x7 fulfills that SNMP manager.</p>
          <p>SNMP includes a procedure that allows device agents to send a notification to the manager when it discovers a critical condition on the device that it is monitoring. This message gets converted into a <b>warning</b> or an <b>alert</b> by the Site24x7 dashboard, depending on the severity rating marked on the message from the agent.</p>
          <p>Site24x7 monitors switches, routers, firewall appliances, power supplies, load balancers, wireless networks, cloud services, and WAN connections. It isn’t a bandwidth traffic monitor. The monitor focuses on connected hardware. A wider view of the Site24x7 package shows that the system also monitors other hardware, such as <b>endpoints </b>and <b>servers</b>. It also tracks the performance of applications. <b>A user behavior module</b> in the package is of particular use to businesses that run websites. It includes <b>real user monitoring</b> to analyze typical buyer journeys and also <b>synthetic web transaction monitoring</b>, which simulates access to a website.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>The plans of Site24x7 are particularly strong on Web application monitoring and combine those services with network and connection testing services. Therefore, businesses that run websites would benefit from choosing this option.</p>
          <p>Site24x7 offers a <b>free network monitoring service</b>. However, this is just a straightforward Ping-based uptime monitor for up to 50 URLs or servers. The cloud platform offers a range of system monitoring and management tools and these are packaged in editions. There are five editions in total:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Website Monitoring</li>
          <li>Infrastructure</li>
          <li>APM</li>
          <li>All-in-one</li>
          <li>MSP</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of these packages include the network monitoring service. Each of the Site24x7 plans is available on a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/site24x7-network-monitoring-free-trial/l/cta/u/9172-7284-0381-2012+66031/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="66031" data-clickid="9172-7284-0381-2012" class="go-link"><b>30-day free trial</b></a>.</p>

          <p>Drill down to see each device’s connections and characteristics</p>
          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p><b>Intermapper</b> crowds a lot of information onto one screen, which saved me time looking through network performance information because I didn’t need to switch pages in the interface. The Intermapper implemented autodiscovery and created a rudimentary map to illustrate live performance status reporting.</p>
          <p>The network map operates as a menu to details on each of the devices on the network. Click on an icon to see the activity on that particular node. You will see throughput data as well as <b>status reports</b>.</p>
          <p>I was able to set <b>performance threshold</b> levels on each of the metrics that the monitor tracks, such as CPU capacity or interface throughout. This helped me monitor availability and other SLA-related conditions because the system will raise an alert if one of those thresholds gets tripped.</p>
          <p>You can set up the preferences in the system so that Intermapper will send you an <b>email</b> or a <b>text message</b> if an alert occurs. That means that I didn’t have to sit and watch the network monitoring screen all of the time.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>Fortra Intermapper is a free tool, so it is a great option for businesses that are trying to tighten spending. This is an on-premises package and it is one of the few network monitoring systems that will run on <b>macOS</b> – it is also available for Windows and Linux.</p>
          <p>Fortra’s Intermapper is on-premises software and it will install on <b>Windows</b>, <b>Linux</b>, or <b>macOS</b>.

           <p>One of the key selling points of <b>AdRem NetCrunch</b> is its ease of use. After installing the software, the user just needs to follow a simple setup guide and then the tool will search your network and populate all of its tables itself. The network map acts as an index for device detail views and alerts let you know when a system component develops a problem.</p>

            <p>Although NetCrunch is able to monitor servers and cloud services, its main feature is its network monitoring system. The tool’s alerting mechanism comes with pre-written rules. A rule is a chain of actions that starts with data collection – this is the monitoring part of the process. Each measurement is compared to a range of acceptable values. If the statistic is outside the range, NetCrunch generates an alert.</p>
            <p>The alerts of the NetCrunch system appear in the console and you can set up the service to forward those warnings as notifications to specific people in your team. Those messages can be sent by email, Slack, SMS, Teams, or other collaboration systems. The tool can also feed tickets into your project management system, such as Jira or Service Desk routing package, such as Trello, Zendesk, or Asana.</p>
            <p>Alerts can also be set up to trigger actions, which creates a mechanism for automatic problem remediation. This possibility is very powerful but takes some planning and you probably won’t get into that capability until you have become an expert user of the NetCrunch system. Alerts can be customized and triggered by a series of conditions.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>This package is suitable for any type of size of business. It is able to monitor virtual systems, such as VMware or Hyper-V and it will also watch the response times of your cloud services and the connections to them. The ease of use of this package makes it particularly appealing for small businesses and startups that might not have a big technical support team on the payroll.</p>
            <p>There are three editions of the NetCrunch package, which makes the system suitable for all sizes of businesses. There are Essentials, which provides SNMP-based device monitoring, Professional, which adds on server and VM monitoring, and Enterprise, which also gives you traffic monitoring and cloud service tracking.

          <p>It is easy to identify the stressed connections that are adding load to the network.</p>
          <p>The Network Performance Monitor is able to blend together the network monitoring effort for many sites and also <b>include cloud resources</b>. As a SaaS package, the service includes the processor to run the monitoring software and storage space for gathered statistics. As well as displaying <b>live statuses</b>, this network monitoring service offers packet capture and <b>analysis utilities</b>.</p>
          <p>By combining both the Network Performance Monitor and the Network Device Monitor, you get complete oversight of your networks. The system implements an <b>autodiscovery</b> function on enrollment that identifies all of the devices connected to your network. The service creates an <b>IT asset inventory</b> and then generates a <b>network topology map</b> from that. The autodiscovery process repeats continuously, so any changes you make to your infrastructure are automatically reflected in the network inventory and the topology map.</p>
          <p>The Network Device Monitor uses the <b>Simple Network Management Protocol</b> (SNMP) to query switches and routers for status reports. These reports are interpreted, providing live device health data on the screen. This system also gathers information about each device, such as make, model, age, and processor capacity.</p>
          <p>Each network device has <b>an SNMP agent </b>preloaded onto it by its manufacturer and if that program spots a problem with the device it sends out a notification. The Datadog Network Device Monitoring service picks up those messages and displays them in the system console as <b>alerts</b>.</p>
          <p>The alerting mechanism in Datadog Network Device Monitoring can be extended to generate an alert if any of the metrics that the system gathers passes a specified <b>threshold</b>. You can set up your own thresholds to get alerts on any condition that you choose. The alerting system is also available in the Network Performance Monitor so traffic limits will be highlighted when bottlenecks start to form.</p>
          <p>You can set up an alert forwarding rule so that you can receive <b>notifications</b> by email, SMS, PagerDuty message or Slack message. This means that you can leave the two network monitoring systems to automatically monitor the network because you know that you will be notified if human attention is needed.</p>
          <p>The traffic monitoring services in the Network Performance Monitoring module don’t just count packets circulating around the network. It is also able to identify data traffic within a <b>virtualization</b> system and it can perform activity monitoring for <b>containers</b>. The tool extends to cloud services, where it is able to show you the traffic in and out of each of your cloud-based accounts.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>Centralized data centers would benefit most from the Datadog Network Monitoring service. The package can be set up remotely to monitor any network without any site visit.</p>
          <p><b>Datadog Network Performance Monitoring</b> and <b>Datadog Network Device Monitoring</b> are just two modules on the Datadog platform.

            <h4>Why do we recommend it?</h4>
            <p><b>ExtraHop Reveal(x)</b> provides a constantly updated network inventory and will immediately spot unauthorized devices on the network. It also uses anomaly detection to identify intrusion and insider threats. The package provides important network detection and response (NDR).</p>
            <p>On testing, the ExtraHop service set itself up by scanning the network and creating an inventory of all connected devices. The tool then operated as a packet sniffer and protocol analyzer, categorizing all traffic on the network. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) recorded activity metrics per user account and IP source.</p>
            <p>Response mechanisms in Reveal(x) can be set up to run automatically. These use orchestration to shut down threats by coordinating with third-party systems. The ExtraHop platform is also available in an edition to protect cloud systems.</p>
            <h4>Who is it recommended for?</h4>
            <p>ExtraHop Reveal(x) is probably a little too complex for the needs of small businesses. However, mid-sized and large companies will benefit from using this network security monitoring system.</p>
            <p>ExtraHop Reveal(x) is offered as a SaaS platform. It is also possible to get the system as a network appliance. You can examine ExtraHop by accessing <a href="https://www.extrahop.com/demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a>.</p>

              <p>The device dashboard uses both <b>SNMP</b> and <b>Ping</b> to check on each device. This enables the system to check for availability because if a device goes offline, it will cease to exist in the SNMP system. If the device has a problem but is still running, the AKIPS console will receive an SNMP Trap message. This is interpreted into an <b>alert</b>. The package can forward alerts as <b>notifications</b> by Teams, Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, or Opsgenie.</p>
              <p>The AKIPS system also raises an alert if a previously detected device disappears. It is possible to define <b>performance thresholds</b> on factors such as traffic throughput. So, for example, if traffic levels on a link suddenly drop, or reach the full capacity of the switch interface to which it connects, the system will generate an alert. These conditions are detailed in the <b>Events Dashboard</b> of the AKIPS console.</p>
              <p>AKIPS provides information about the network that can help with capacity. This category of data includes information on unused interfaces or traffic patterns per link over time. The system can forward its data as logs to <b>SIEM</b> systems for activity analysis.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>AKIPS doesn’t publish its price list, which makes a decision on its suitability for small businesses difficult to make. The package doesn’t include system to check on internet links to cloud platforms or between sites, so this is a LAN management package. The service is ideal for monitoring a single network.</p>
              <p>The AKIPS system installs in <b>a VM</b>, which means that it can run on any operating system. Within the hypervisor, the network monitoring software actually runs on <b>FreeBSD Unix</b>. However, that operating system is included in the installation package. You can get a demo to see how the system works and then access the package yourself with a <a href="https://www.akips.com/lp/nb/network-monitoring-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-day free trial</a>.</p>

              <p>The network maps show broken connections that need attention in red.</p>
              <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
              <p>The <b>SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor</b> is an automated tracking system that identifies all devices connected to the network, maps them, and watches out for performance issues. This system will alert you of gathering problems and send a notification. Alongside solid vulnerability scanning and advanced options to create and monitor policies, this is by far the top choice for network monitoring systems.</p>
              <p>Any devices, applications, or services that have been discovered can also be viewed on a <b>network topology map</b> where you can see how your infrastructure links together. The <b>NetPath</b> feature allows you to<b> trace packet transfers hop-by-hop</b>, which can help to diagnose the origin of performance network issues more effectively.</p>
              <p>The custom alerts system enables you to<b> set trigger conditions for alerts</b>. Once the trigger conditions are met the software will send you a notification by <b>email</b> or <b>SMS</b> to let you know that an event has taken place. The user can view a comprehensive list of alerts according to severity by going to the <b>All Active Alerts</b> page.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>I was impressed how this tool automates network monitoring – it even sets itself up, so it is suitable for all sizes of enterprises because it doesn’t require specialized network management knowledge to operate. Alerts mean that you can assume everything is running OK unless you get a notification, so you can spend your time on other issues and let the NPM take care of the network. Our testing surfaced the following pros and cons for NPM.</p>

            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p><b>Nagios Core</b> is one of the most reliable and respected open-source IT asset monitoring packages that will monitor networks, applications, and servers. This version of Nagios is free to use but you should also consider the paid <b>Nagios XI</b> edition.</p>
            <p>We were able to track performance events through the alerts system, which sent out notifications by <b>email</b> and <b>SMS</b>. You can view the <b>Alert History </b>section to see what alerts were created and when. The list of alerts is also color-coded making it easier to prioritize critical alerts.</p>
            <p>We were able to use APIs to integrate other network services. If you require more functions then you can also check the <b>thousands of community plugins available</b> on the <b>Nagios Exchange </b>to help you add additional functions. For example, there is a check SNMP CPU load plugin that allows you to monitor the SNMP load or <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/cpu-monitoring-software-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPU usage of your network device</a>.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>Nagios Core doesn’t have a proper user interface but it has a very flexible and powerful discovery and data-gathering engine. Therefore, it is a good option if you want to create your own monitoring application with a free data representation tool, such as Kibana or Prometheus, and feed in data from this tool.</p>
            <p><b>Nagios Core </b>is an excellent free network monitoring software however the setup can be slightly more hands-on than other products on this list. <a href="https://www.nagios.org/projects/nagios-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download Nagios Core for free</a>, or depending on your needs, see how it compares with <a href="https://www.nagios.org/downloads/nagios-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Nagios XI</b></a>.

            <h4>Why do we recommend it?</h4>
            <p><b>Catchpoint Network Experience</b> is intended for use as part of a suite of tools that ensures the successful delivery of Web pages and other Web applications. Therefore, this tool is excellent for checking on the successful delivery of Web systems. It forms part of a monitoring chain that can quickly identify the root cause of performance issues.</p>
            <p>The other modules in the Catchpoint platform are an application monitor and real user and synthetic monitoring tools for Web applications. The network service checks on the performance of connections to the different servers that contribute to the successful delivery of a Web page and its contents. These other servers include content delivery networks (CDNs), DNS servers, and serverless hosts of the microservices that get triggered by user interactions within a Web page.</p>
            <p>The Network Experience system also analyzes the activities of virtual networks, such as Secured Access Service Edge (SASE) and SD-WANs. It will identify performance issues with remote access and site-to-site VPNs and then trace through a LAN to the Web servers that hold the company’s websites.</p>
            <h4>Who is it recommended for?</h4>
            <p>The full Catchpoint platform is specifically designed to track the performance of websites, so it isn’t a good choice for businesses that need a LAN monitoring service. Businesses that host their own sites will be the most suitable customers for the Catchpoint system. However, those companies that use hosting services and CDNs to optimize delivery can also benefit from the Catchpoint service.</p>
            <p>Although Catchpoint is a SaaS package, it does have an onsite element, which is called the Enterprise Node. This installs on one of your servers and manages the monitoring of your Web host and the network links between it and the outside world. This agent runs on <b>RHEL</b> and <b>CentOS Linux</b>. It can also be run as a virtual appliance over <b>Hyper-V</b> or <b>VMware</b>. Catchpoint is available for a <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14-day free trial</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Icinga</b> was developed as an improvement to Nagios and that background gives this system a big advantage over many of the other tools on this list. It is completely free to use, just like <b>Nagios Core</b> but, like <b>Nagios XI</b>, it has a useful graphical user interface that is delivered with pre-written screens but is also customizable. Icinga is still compatible with Nagios plug-ins, so users of this system can enhance the monitoring tool from Nagios Exchange as well as with plug-ins from the much smaller Icinga Exchange.</p>
            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p>We love that Icinga is a free, open-source monitoring package for networks, applications, and servers. It was developed by a team of Nagios creators who were unhappy with the direction of that system’s evolution.</p>
            <p>You can log in to the GUI and use the dashboard to view an overview of performance management. The dashboard displays whether there are any problems with performance or availability and color-codes them according to severity. <b>Critical</b> or <b>Down</b> network devices are marked in red.</p>
            <p>Extensions or <b>Icinga Modules</b>, allow you to add more functions to the program. For example, the <b>Icinga Module for vSphere</b> allows you to monitor virtual machines and host systems. There is a range of community-created plugins you can download for free from the<b> Icinga Exchange</b>.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>As it is open source, Icinga can be rewritten and its compatibility with Nagios means that it can be extended by the free plug-in library of that rival system. These features make it great for network engineers with programming skills who want to create a bespoke network monitoring tool.</p>
            <p>Overall, Icinga is a scalable solution that gives you control over how you manage your environment. Icinga is available for Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Raspbian, and Windows. You can <a href="https://icinga.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the free trial version</a>.</p>

          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p><b>Zabbix</b> is a free tool that can be expanded by templates. This service can monitor networks, servers, and applications and it uses SNMP to discover and monitor network devices.</p>
          <p>Network monitoring templates make it easy to configure the program for monitoring. For example, there are <b>preconfigured</b> <b>templates</b> for vendors such as<b><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/cisco-network-monitoring-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Cisco</a>, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell, Intel, Netgear,</b> and more. If you require more variety then you can access even more community templates form the Zabbix community site.</p>
          <p>To ensure that you can respond to alerts in time, <b>Zabbix</b> has a <b>notification system</b>. Alerts are sent by <b>email, SMS, messenger, jabber, </b>or<b> custom scripts</b> to update you on evolving network security events. The notification content can be customized according to the recipient to make sure that the point of contact has everything they need to reopen intelligently.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>Zabbix is a Linux-based on-premises package and its competitive edge against many of the tools on this list is that it is free to use. The screens for this system contain great data visualization features and they can be customized, which makes this one of the easiest tools to tailor without the need for technical abilities.</p>
          <p>Zabbix is one of the top Linux network monitoring tools on the market. Autodiscovery and templates make the program straightforward to deploy. The software for the package is installed on <b>Linux</b>, <b>macOS</b>, and <b>Unix</b>. Although the main server for Zabbix isn’t available for <b>Windows</b>, there is an agent program that enables it to monitor Windows endpoints over a network. You can <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the software for free</a>.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>Its API-based email protection integrates directly with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, without having to reroute traffic or invest in a secure email gateway. Moreover, it has a wide coverage of threats to address multiple threats. Its all-in-one console offers centralized management and visibility to admins.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: AI-Powered Phishing Simulation</b></h4>
      <p>A key feature of Guardz is its AI-powered phishing simulation that helps identify the weakest links in your organization, and those that are most likely to fall during a phishing attack. Using this information, you can strengthen these weak links to avoid an attack.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 8.6</b></span></h4>
      <p>Guardz provides a decent level of customer support. Its dedicated support team and extensive self-supporting documentation can answer most concerns and questions. The financial stability can be better, and it remains to be seen if the company will increase its headcount in the future.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><b>Guardz</b> is a cloud platform of security scanning systems that aims to protect company resources and data from hacker access. One of the key routes into a business’s systems is through email tricks, such as phishing to gain account credentials or impersonation to manipulate employees into action. This package also filters out spam emails.</p>
      <p>This package specifically monitors the components of <b>Microsoft 365 </b>and&nbsp; <b>Google Workspace</b>. It protects data held in One Drive by scanning attacks launched against email accounts in Outlook/Exchange Server and attacks on data in Google Drive through trick emails sent to Gmail accounts.</p>
      <p>When this system spots spam emails or attacks, such as phishing or business email compromise (BEC) it moves those suspicious communications to a quarantine area away from the mailboxes of users. The package alerts technicians by recording the detection in the Guardz dashboard. The emails can be viewed and assessed in case they have been flagged as malicious in error.</p>
      <p>The Guardz system is also able to scan endpoints for attacks and alert on discoveries such as malware or intrusion. This package is intended for use by managed service providers to protect the systems of their clients.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>This system is available to individuals as well as to teams because the minimum team size for the account is one. However, Guardz insists that the package needs to be administered by a managed service provider rather than by an in-house IT support team.</p>
<p>Guardz is available for use by managed service providers to protect the data of their clients and clean the email systems of those protected companies. You can examine the Guardz platform with a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/guardz-anti-spam-software/l/cta/u/3348-7141-8497-0004+212897/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="212897" data-clickid="3348-7141-8497-0004" class="go-link"><b>14-day free trial</b></a>.</p>

                <h3>EDITOR'S CHOICE</h3>
                                    <p><b>Guardz</b> is our top pick for anti-spam software because this package also identifies phishing and BEC threats, blocking all three hacker activities. The tool will identify malware and ransomware in attachments to emails and block them as well. When this package spots a malicious email, it raises an alert in the system dashboard and moves the offending email into quarantine. A technician can review emails logged into the quarantine system to check whether some genuine emails got miscategorized. In these instances, it is possible to restore the intercepted email back to the recipient’s mailbox. This tool specializes in protecting Gmail and Google Drive in Google Workspace and Outlook, Exchange Server, and OneDrive in the Microsoft 365 suite. </p>

<p><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></p>
<p>MailWasher allows users to preview emails on the server before they are downloaded. This unique option gives greater control and visibility to users and, at the same time, protects the devices from malware. It is also compatible with many email clients.</p>
<p><b>Feature-in-Focus: Real-Time Blacklist Integration</b></p>
<p>MailWasher integrates with real-time blacklists to identify messages that come from known spam sources. This saves time and resources, and is also highly effective in detecting and blocking spam messages. This blacklist can also be customized to meet your unique needs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 3.9</b></span></p>
<p>Many questions linger about the future of this company from a customer service standpoint. Currently, it doesn’t have a dedicated team, and its overall employee headcount is also low, raising questions about how it can offer support in the future. Though it has self-service documentation, it may not be enough. The funding/revenue is also on the lower side.</p>
<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Mailwasher</strong> is a proxy service that intercepts emails and blocks spam and malware while passing through all other emails. This service integrates with a lot more email services that the other options on this list and that includes Webmail systems.</p>
<p>To stop viruses from entering your inbox, the program allows you to <strong>preview and delete emails before they are downloaded </strong>to your computer. By blocking emails like this you can view information within the email without opening it and leaving your computer at risk of transmitting a virus.</p>
<p>Filtering is another way that <strong>Mailwasher </strong>monitors incoming emails for suspicious signs. The <strong>filter can spot spam content and offensive words </strong>so that the sender can be automatically blacklisted from future correspondence. To stop false alerts you can add colleagues and clients to your ‘<em>friends’</em> list.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Mailwasher is a good choice for any business. Small businesses can access Mailwasher Free, which only protects one email account but it is possible to sign up for several accounts.</p>
<p>There are two versions of <strong>Mailwasher </strong>available to download: <strong>Mailwasher Free </strong>and <strong>Mailwasher Pro</strong>. <strong>Mailwasher Free </strong>is available <strong><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/mailwasher-anti-spam-software/l/cta/u/6740-6178-8253-1875+212897/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="212897" data-clickid="6740-6178-8253-1875" class="go-link">free of charge</a></strong> and supports one email address.&nbsp;<b>MailWasher Pro </b>starts from $49.95 (£37.71) and supports multiple email addresses with support seven days a week.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>ESET Protect Mail Plus is a multi-layered email protection solution. It combines proprietary anti-spam, anti-phishing, and anti-malware technologies to provide advanced defense against known and zero-day threats. Its 64-bit architecture with clustering support ensures performance and scalability for organizations of all sizes.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: Anti-Spam Engine</b></h4>
      <p>The anti-spam engine of ESET uses a combination of techniques like SMTP protection, SPF, DKIM validation, and backscatter protection to filter spam emails, making it highly effective. These filters can also identify ransomware, malware, and phishing attacks to protect your organization. Furthermore, you can also set up custom rules based on your organization’s needs.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 9.6</b></span></h4>
      <p>A solid company with good financials, well-developed self-supporting documentation, and a dedicated team providing customer service. Its employee job satisfaction index is also good. Due to these factors, we can expect continued high-quality support from ESET.</p>
      <h4>Why do we recommend it?</h4>
      <p>The anti-spam feature of <b>ESET Protect Mail Plus</b> will improve with service and it will also adapt to each user’s preferences. It could be that a particular unsolicited email is from a site that the user visits and its contents are of interest to the recipient. In which case, repeated access by that user to emails from that source will de-list that source as a spam sender.</p>
      <p>The <b>anti-spam</b> and <b>anti-phishing</b> processes are a little more complicated. Spam filtering relies on whether emails from particular sources and with particular subject lines have previously been listed as unwanted. This blacklisting is based both on global experience and on the reaction of the user, such as deleting an email without reading it.</p>
      <p>The anti-phishing process is similar to the anti-spam service. It uses machine learning and external source and text databases to spot undesirable emails.</p>
      <h4>Who is it recommended for?</h4>
      <p>This system only operates on the Microsoft Exchange Server and IBM Domino email systems, so if you don’t use either of those, you will need to look elsewhere for a spam filter. The smallest package you can buy covers five hosts, so it isn’t suitable for very small businesses.</p>
      <p>ESET Protect Mail Plus is a subscription package with an annual rate and you can get a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/eset-anti-spam-software/l/cta/u/5517-2604-0759-4021+212897/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="212897" data-clickid="5517-2604-0759-4021" class="go-link"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a>.

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This is a comprehensive email security platform that comes with advanced anti-spam filters and phishing email detectors. It is cloud-based, and hence ideal for both MSPs and organizations catering to a geographically-diverse workforce. It has been featured in the Virus Bulletin Q4 2024 for achieving a malware false positive rate of 0.00%.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: Anti-Spam Filters</b></h4>
      <p>A highlight of TitanHQ is its advanced spam filters that take a multi-layered approach to spam detection. It uses Bayesian auto-learning, heuristics, and real-time blacklists. Together, these strategies block spam from known IP addresses and follow specific patterns. Also, its machine-learning strategies help the tool to learn and adapt to evolving spam patterns for a high success rate.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 7.8</b></span></h4>
      <p>TitanHQ is a small but growing company. Its self-supporting documentation is comprehensive, and the funding has been adequate to support its operations. Though the employee’s job satisfaction score is reasonable, the concern is its low employee count. This can affect the company’s customer support if it expands to newer markets in the future.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Email Security</strong> implements AI-based detection that scans through the contents of each email and looks for anomalies, such as address spoofing. The tool can build up its own blacklist for a specific client company but the company doesn’t deploy a global blacklist like N-able Mail Assure.</p>
      <p><strong>IP address whitelisting</strong> and <strong>blacklisting </strong>controls whether mail reaches your inbox or gets blocked from future communication. For wider security, you can apply different degrees of <strong>Spam Confidence Levels </strong>to <strong>users</strong>, <strong>user groups</strong>, and <strong>domains</strong>. By segmenting your email environment in this fashion you can manage potential entry points much more effectively.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Email Security is a cloud-based system, so you don’t need to have technical skills to install it. The system plugs into Microsoft 365, so it will monitor all of the Outlook mailboxes for your users. However, the TitanHQ Email Security system isn’t available for any other email system. The minimum number of email accounts this service will cover is 25, so it isn’t suitable for very small businesses.</p>
<p>Prices are levied as a subscription with a rate per user per month. There is a <b>minimum order</b> of 25 user licenses. The price per user per month lowers if you choose a longer payment cycle. The options range from a monthly payment to a 3-year payment plan. The <b>lowest price</b> comes with the 3-year plan, which works out at $1.49 (£1.12) per user per month. However, you have to pay for the whole payment period in advance, so that 3-year option for 25 users works out at an upfront payment of $1,336,50 (£1008.95).

      <p>A highlight of this tool is its Bayesian filters that continuously learn and adapt to emerging spam patterns to provide 100% protection over time. It also minimizes false positives by decoding messages to analyze their content. Accordingly, it classifies an email as spam or legitimate. You can also add sophisticated rules to customize these filters.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>SpamSieve</strong> is specifically designed to operate on the native email system for Macs and other email clients that run on macOS. This tool is very easy to install because it is offered as a plug-in. The system builds up a whitelist and a blacklist over time to fine-tune blocking for your regular activity.</p>
      <p>This spam filtering solution includes whitelisting and blacklisting and it uses <b>machine learning</b> to improve spam identification in your Inbox over time. You can set up your own block list and also customize other features of the interface, such as its color and layout. SpamSieve also allows you to create your own mailbox management <b>scripts</b> that perform different actions depending on factors such as the sender or subject line.</p>
      <p>SpamSieve works as <b>a plug-in</b> so you can access its functions from within your email client instead of needing to go to a different application. It will work with a long list of email systems on Macs, including Apple Mail (Mail.app), Airmail, Entourage, MailMate, Mailsmith, Postbox 5, PowerMail, and Outlook.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>As it only runs on Macs, this tool is suitable for businesses that only have Macs on site. The pricing structure means that you can get a license for just one Mac or many, which means that it is a scalable service that is easy to expand as a small business grows. Large organizations get bulk discounts.</p>
<p>A single-user license costs $30 (£22.65) per year and you can also get a two user license, called the Family plan, for $48 ($36.24). A site-wide plan is priced on consultation.

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>A comprehensive email protection tool that leverages the latest technologies to detect and block spam and neutralize phishing attempts. Its cloud-based architecture makes it easy to deploy and scale for businesses of all sizes. Its detailed reporting and customizable policies are other key additions.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: AI-powered Threat Detection</b></h4>
      <p>The standout feature of Trustifi Inbound Shield is its AI-powered threat detection, which analyzes incoming messages in real-time and, based on its patterns, blocks the spam. The advantage of this feature is that it continuously learns and adapts to match the evolving changes in spam messages.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 6.2</b></span></h4>
      <p>Trustifi is a mixed bag when it comes to customer support. Its self-service documentation is excellent and can answer most questions. While the job satisfaction index is high, the number of employees is really low. Though this approach seems to be working well for the company so far, there are questions about how it can look in the future. Its funding is also a little suspect, and this is one area to consider.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Trustifi</strong> is a very effective spam filter. However, there are many tools on this list that match that description. The advantage that this tool has over its rivals is that it is very easy to implement. The service is delivered as a plug-in for all of the major email systems, including those that are cloud-based, such as Microsoft Exchange and Gmail.</p>
      <p>The Trustifi system is able to spot spam, phishing emails, and bulk emails that are termed “graymail.” The system uses a combination of <b>AI-based threat detection</b> and email address and IP address blacklists. It looks at source email addresses and correlates them to known identifies of employees to block impersonation attempts. It can also detect <b>malicious links</b> to impersonating or infected websites.</p>

      <p>This is a cloud-hosted email security service that filters and blocks spam emails based on known patterns and their origin IP addresses.

It is also easy to set up and requires no installation or changes to email client settings.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: Collective Intelligence Filtering</b></h4>
      <p>MX Guarddog takes a collective intelligence filtering approach to spam detection. It analyzes patterns across users and scans through IP addresses to identify spam messages. This approach is known to be more effective than traditional keyword-based filters. It also supports updates to definitions in real time, without requiring manual intervention from administrators.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>MX Guarddog</strong> operates as a proxy service that receives your emails, filters them, and then passes on the good ones. It blocks malware, spam, phishing attempts, and DDoS attacks. The system is a good continuity service, too because it stores up emails if your own mail server goes offline and delivers them when it comes back.</p>
      <p>Legitimate mail is forwarded straight to your email server. <strong>MX Guarddog automatically syncs email addresses from Windows AD</strong>, <strong>LDAP</strong>, and <strong>cPanel </strong>systems for convenience. In the event that your server goes down, your mail will be stored and automatically delivered to you the next time you’re online.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>SPAMfighter is a community-driven spam filtering tool that integrates with all Windows-based email clients. It offers both a free and a pro version geared for individuals and businesses, respectively. The pro version comes with advanced features like automatic whitelist management and language filtering.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: Community-Driven Approach</b></h4>
      <p>The highlight of this tool is its community-driven approach, which means emails with specific patterns are categorized as spam based on how multiple users report them. This feature helps SPAMfighter to identify new spam threats more effectively.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p>The <strong>SPAMfighter</strong> system works on a crowdsourced intelligence model. When a user receives an email and marks it as spam, the source email address and IP address get flagged. If enough users flag the same source, it gets added to the global blacklist.</p>
      <p>The user interface is simple to navigate and you can <b>view live statistics on blocked messages</b>. In addition, you also have <b>Spam Abuse Reporting </b>at the click of a button if you need to gather information. Being able to organize all of this security information helps to make sure that you know about everything that is trying to reach out to your account.</p>

<p>Home users will definitely want to try the free SPAMfighter. For businesses, the reliance on enough people reporting a spam email campaign might seem a little weak. However, the system has more than 8 million users, so it should be able to catch most spam campaigns.</p>
<p>Apart from the free SPAMfighter for home use, there are three business options: SPAMfighter Mail Gateway, which installs on Windows, SPAM fighter Hosted Mail Gateway, which is a SaaS version, and SPAMfighter Exchange Module, which is a special plug-in for Microsoft Exchange Server.

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>ORF Fusion is a server-side anti-spam solution that uses a multi-layered approach to identify and block spam. Besides spam filtering, it also offers detailed logging and reporting, making it ideal for compliance and internal monitoring. Additionally, it integrates well into existing email infrastructure.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: 23-layer Filtering System</b></h4>
      <p>A standout feature of ORF Fusion is its 23-layer filtering system. Every incoming email goes through these 23 filters, including DNS and SURBL blacklist evaluations, greylisting, keyword and content analysis, and more. Such an approach protects against a wide range of email threats.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ORF Fusion</strong> is a software package that runs on Windows. It is specifically designed to integrate with Exchange Server and IIS SMTP server. This tool operates through a blacklisting mechanism to which, over time, are added whitelisted addresses. The balance between acceptable and banned email addresses is interlinked with a series of other scans and checks on each arriving email.</p>
      <p>You can create your own whitelists to make sure that your trusted email senders aren’t put through spam filtering. The user also has control over what happens to those emails that are caught by the spam filter. For instance, you can bounce them to reject the transmission, keep the mail, or redirect it to a different mailbox.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>Zerospam is a fully cloud-based solution that uses AI to identify a wide range of email-based threats, like spam, malware, ransomware, and more. It is also compatible with platforms like Microsoft 365 and Exchange, while deployment is simple and instant. Its user-friendly interface is another aspect that makes this tool ideal for all users.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: AI and Machine Learning</b></h4>
      <p>ZeroSpam uses AI and machine learning to continuously learn and adapt to changing email threat patterns. These technologies also allow the tool to analyze large volumes of emails quickly and efficiently, reducing the false positive rate.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Zerospam</strong> claims to block 98.99 percent of all spam. This could be due to an overzealous policy. However, the administrator will loosen the detection process over time. Some blocked emails might be valid and as you approve them, the system alters its blocking algorithm, which leads to a more accurate assessment for future emails.</p>
      <p>The tool will block <strong>Trojans</strong> and other <strong>malware</strong> in attachments and identify links to suspicious sites easily. However, identifying spam and phishing attempts is a lot more complicated. The Zerospam system uses a machine learning method to adapt its blocking system.</p>
      <p>The Zerospam policy requires administrator input in the first few weeks of operation. This can be time-consuming. However, it is the only way that a business can get a truly <strong>tailored</strong> spam filter that properly adapts to the regular pattern of email activity that the company expects to receive.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Zerospam offers a very reasonable price, which makes it appealing to businesses of all sizes. Its method of channeling all inbound emails means you save a lot of space on your own servers and infections won’t be able to get anywhere near your own system. This is a particularly good option for businesses that run virtual offices with a dispersed, home-based workforce.</p>
<p>Zerospam is based in Italy and the company sets its subscription price in Euros. This is 5 Euros ($5.44/£4.39) per month to cover five mailboxes or 10 Euros ($10.88/£8.78) per month to protect up to 1,000 mailboxes. There is also a <strong>Premium</strong> plan that adds on email archiving and costs 20 Euros ($21.76/£17.56) per month for 1,000 mailboxes. You can get a <a href="https://www.zerospam.eu/en/free-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-day free trial</a> to test the Zerospam system.</p>

<p>The <b>patch manager</b> in NinjaOne RMM automates the deployment of patches to ensure systems are always up-to-date. The service will scan and update endpoints running Windows, macOS, and Linux and will update the <b>operating system</b> where necessary. The package also updates <b>core applications,</b> such as Java, Adobe, and Chrome, where necessary. The patch manager also provides detailed reports and alerts to keep IT teams informed.</p>
<p>NinjaOne’s <b>remote access</b> tool allows IT professionals to securely access and troubleshoot endpoints from anywhere. This feature is invaluable for resolving issues quickly and minimizing downtime. The tool offers a range of access options, including full control, view-only, and file transfer. Companies that currently use Splashtop, TeamViewer, ScreenConneft, or ConnectWise can just slot in those remote access tools instead of using the RMM’s native remote desktop system.</p>

<p>The remote <b>system monitoring</b> capabilities of NinjaOne RMM provide real-time insights into the health and performance of endpoints. Customizable alerts and templates allow IT teams to stay on top of potential issues before they escalate.

<div class="additional-info">
      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>Syncro combines RMM and PSA into the same platform to offer extensive capabilities for technicians. Also, features like unlimited endpoint monitoring, scripting, patch management, ticketing, and billing reduce the need for multiple tools.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: Policy Inheritance</b></h4>
      <p>With this feature, you can assign hierarchical policies to folders, and the same will apply to all sub-folders within those folders. The advantage of this tool is that global policies that are common across all folders can be implemented more efficiently. It can also ensure consistent configurations.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p>The <b>Syncro</b> system is a great package for MSPs because it includes professional services automation features as well s remote monitoring and management tools. You get a customizable ticketing system in this bundle as well as the remote monitoring tools and automated asset management services. The system includes a patch manager as well.</p>
      <p>The RMM system is stronger at managing endpoints running <b>Windows</b> than any other operating system this is because its automated patch manager is only available for Windows – the system isn’t able to update devices running Linux, Unix, or macOS.</p>
      <p>The monitoring services in the bundle cover all levels of systems, including networks, services, and endpoints. The monitor raises <b>an aler</b><strong>t</strong> if any performance issue arises. This enables a single technician can manage many sites at once because it isn’t necessary to pay attention to the automated monitoring console unless a notification arrives.</p>
      <p>The <b>automation</b> features in the RMM package enable you to set up scripts for remediation. Another option is to generate a ticket for the problem so that support technicians can get allocated an investigative task. It is also possible to just set up alerts to get forwarded to specific members of staff via SMS.</p>

      <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
      <p>The Syncro system is suitable for managed service providers of all sizes. However, startups and all MSPs will benefit the most from this system because you get all of the functions in the package at per-technician pricing. So a single freelance technician just starting out gets all of the software that a large organization enjoys.</p>
      <p>Syncro has only one plan. This is an <b>all-in-one</b> package that gives you access to all of the services on the Syncro platform. You can get access to the service with a <strong><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/syncro-rmm-software-and-tools/l/cta/u/7063-6391-2685-5953+146634/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="146634" data-clickid="7063-6391-2685-5953" class="go-link">14-day free trial</a></strong>.</p>
      <div class="ctech-content-on-bk  "><p></p>
<p>The <b>Syncro RMM</b> system is a good option for small MSPs because it doesn’t impose charges on the volume of assets that are being monitored and managed. You just pay a fee per technician and no other factor is taken into account in the price. You can pay for the service at a monthly rate, which means that you can get your new MSP up and running for very little money. However, if you choose to pay on the annual plan, you save money per month. The full package also gives you PSA tools for managing the MSP business.</p>

      <p><strong>SuperOps</strong> is an extensive RMM package and the SaaS platform also offers a PSA bundle. It is also possible to get a discounted price for a combination of both packages. Although not officially an ITIL tool, the presentation of the package reads a lot like an ITIL menu.</p>
      <p>Although RMMs are <b>essential for MSPs</b>, there is no reason why the in-house technician team of an IT department shouldn’t use this package to manage a corporate system. The units of the <b>SaaS platform</b> form a stack with the <b>Asset Management</b> tool providing an information base for system management processes.</p>
      <p>The <b>Policy Management</b> system works in tandem with the <b>Alert Management</b> system to set up automated monitoring processes. When a policy rule gets tripped an alert is triggered. So, technicians don’t have to be allocated to watch monitoring screens all day – just when a problem is notified.</p>
      <p><b>Patch Management</b> is a major contributor to security and the efficient operations of the managed system. The SuperOps system refers to the software inventory maintained by the Asset Management module and polls providers for updates and patches. These are copied over automatically when they become available.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This is an all-in-one IT management platform that integrates RMM, PSA, help desk, and patch management. Its per-technician model also makes it easy to budget and track costs.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: AI Copilot</b></h4>
      <p>Atera’s AI Copilot leverages AI to automate routine tasks, provide real-time insights, and even offer context-aware recommendations where appropriate. It can further improve efficiency by autonomously resolving minor IT issues, thereby reducing the need for manual interference.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><b>Atera </b>is a cloud system that is very similar to NinjaRMM. The remote monitoring and management service is included in combination with a professional services automation (PSA) package. With this bundle, IT departments and MSPs get all the software they need to support their sites and users.</p>
      <p>For managing customer concerns, Atera has a<b> ticketing system </b>that allows you to <b>create tickets</b> and<b> track how long they take to be resolved</b>. In the tickets menu, you can view a list of tickets detailing performance issues and when the resolution is due. The ticketing system is handy because it enables the technicians to resolve any problems quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>The remote access capabilities of <b>Atera</b> are also first-class. You can<b> access computers, servers, applications, and files remotely </b>through the GUI. Users can remotely access devices from the device view or through a ticket or alert. Also, technicians can monitor endpoints with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>The fast and easy remote access makes it easy for a technician to click through and manage devices firsthand. All sessions are protected with <b>TLS and 256-bit AES encryption</b> so you open up minimal vulnerabilities by interacting with a remote network.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The big advantage that Atera has over many of the rival remote management and monitoring (RMM) systems is that it is priced per technician with no minimum number of seats per account. This means that all package utilities are available from the smallest MSP companies and even independent technicians all the way to much larger IT Departments.</p>
<p>Atera is ideal for MSPs and IT Departments that want a tool that provides a solid user experience and remote access. Prices start at $129 per month per technician when paid annually for MSPs.

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>Another comprehensive platform that brings together remote monitoring, automation, patch management, and more to improve efficiency and reduce the need for multiple tools. In particular, its integration with Apple Business Manager allows zero-touch deployment for Apple devices. In turn, this can help with device management as well.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: Site Concentrator</b></h4>
      <p>This is a unique feature that makes it possible to set up one device in the network as a centralized cache for updates and patches. This acts as the site concentrator, providing the required information to other devices connected to it. The advantages of this model are reduced bandwidth consumption and faster deployment, especially in areas with limited connectivity.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>N-able N-sight</strong> is a similar package to NinjaOne. N-able offers two RMM packages and N-sight is aimed at smaller MSPs and also the operations departments of businesses for in-house use. The N-able system is a cloud platform that is charged for by subscription.</p>
      <p>Endpoint detection and response functionalities to help you detect threats throughout the remote environment. For example, you can <b>scan files continuously in real-time</b> to make sure that no malicious content has made its way onto the network. When threats are detected, <b>machine learning </b>enables you to respond quickly.</p>
      <p>The NetPath feature is another useful addition. With <b>NetPath</b>, you can view <b>network performance</b> on a <b>map</b>, to see where connectivity issues are between devices.

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>A unified platform that combines network performance monitoring with endpoint management, to give technicians the flexibility to monitor and manage devices across multiple sites. Its well-developed and intuitive console provides technicians with the required information to stay on top of issues.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: Probe-based Architecture</b></h4>
      <p>The probe-based architecture used by ManageEngine RMM allows the deployment of probes at remote sites and across multiple sites. These probes can collect fault and performance data and consolidate it in a central location for further analysis.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ManageEngine RMM Central</strong> is made for MSPs and it would be identical to all of the RMMs listed above were it not for the fact that this is a software package rather than a SaaS platform. You can install this software on Windows Server or on an account with AWS or Azure.</p>
      <p>The RMM scours a network on enrollment, discovers all devices, and draws up an asset inventory from it. The tool then scours each endpoint to create a <strong>software inventory</strong>. These two processes repeat continuously to provide constantly up-to-date asset records. The system will automatically generate a network topology from the hardware inventory data.</p>
      <p>The software inventory forms the basis of an <strong>automated patch manager</strong>, allowing RMM Central to keep all software up to date. Controls in the patch management settings allow check and authorize each update or just let the system apply all patches automatically at the next available maintenance window.</p>
      <p>With all devices mapped, the RMM will implement performance monitoring on the client’s network. Any anomaly that arises in resource usage will trigger <strong>an alert</strong>. The alerting mechanism allows technicians to get on with other tasks, knowing that they will be informed of any event that needs attention.</p>
      <p>The package also includes a <strong>remote control</strong>/remote access service that gives technicians views of the desktop or operating system of each managed device.</p>
      <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
      <p>ManageEngine RMM Central includes an autodiscovery function, network mapping, automated monitoring through a system of alerts, and management for servers and virtualizations. This tool is a good choice for any MSP that needs to squeeze extra value out of its human resources.</p>
      <p>There are two editions for RMM Central: <strong>Free</strong> and <strong>Enterprise</strong>. The Free edition has all of the functions available in the Enterprise version, except that it is limited to monitoring 20 endpoints and 5 network devices. You can get a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/manageengine-rmm-software-and-tools-free-trial-rmm-software-and-tools/l/cta/u/2837-0726-8245-3944+146634/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="146634" data-clickid="2837-0726-8245-3944" class="go-link"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a> of the Enterprise edition.</p>
      <div class="ctech-content-on-bk  "><p></p>
<p><strong>ManageEngine RMM Central</strong> offers deployment flexibility for those businesses that want to host their own services. The tool is also available for installation on AWS and Azure. You can run an entire MSP technical support team with this package and small businesses get all of the bells and whistles for free. RMM Central saves technicians time by automating most of the important monitoring and management tasks. That saves your business money.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This is a cloud-based multi-tenant monitoring solution that allows MSPs to manage multiple client accounts through a single console. It integrates multiple capabilities, like application performance management, log analysis, and infrastructure monitoring, to get comprehensive visibility.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: Customer Health View</b></h4>
      <p>This feature provides a high-level operational status of every customer account, making it easy to assess the health of all client environments. Additionally, its dashboard is also notable because it provides the real-time data of all monitors within a single client account for quick resolution of issues.</p>
      <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
      <p><b>Site24x7 MSP Edition</b> is an adapted version of the full Site24x7 platform. This edition enables the creation of sub-accounts so managed service providers can keep the data of each client separate. As well as a full complement of monitoring systems, this package includes log management and network configuration services.</p>
      <p>The <b>Network Monitoring</b> service of this package includes an autodiscovery feature. This identifies all of the equipment connected to the network and documents them in a hardware inventory. The system also provides an instantly generated network topology map. The discovery process repeats continuously and if changes have been made, the inventory gets updated. The topology map is generated from inventory data every time it is accessed, so that gets automatically updated as well.</p>
      <p>Other features in the network monitor include a device status checker that is driven by the <b>Simple Network Management Protocol</b> (SNMP). It also provides traffic analysis, communicating with the switches and routers from all the major network equipment providers by using the NetFlow, IPFIX, J-Flow, sFlow, cFlow, AppFlow, and NetStream protocols.</p>
      <p>A new feature in the platform is the <b>Digital Risk Analyzer</b>. This looks at vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems, such as gateways, email systems, and websites. The scanner gives each asset a security score and provides advice on how security can be tightened.</p>
      <p>All of the monitoring systems in the package have a series of performance thresholds placed on them. These are leveled to provide technicians time if traffic volumes approach a switch’s full capacity or if a server’s CPU gets heavily loaded. If a threshold is crossed, the system raises<b> an alert</b>. You can set up the monitor to forward alerts to technicians as notifications by email, SMS, voice call, push notification, or Slack message.</p>

<h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
<p>The MSP plan is suitable for any size of managed service provider. The pricing works on the number of assets that are under management, not the number of clients, sites, users, or technicians. The package can be expanded easily by adding on capacity upgrades. So, small to very large MSPs will find the system fits their needs.</p>

      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: Zero Trust Security Architecture</b></h4>
      <p>This architecture requires the verification of every action, thereby preventing unauthorized access or misuse of existing credentials. It also improves the security posture of the entire organization.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><b>LogMeIn Resolve</b> offers remote monitoring and management for endpoints. The system also provides remote access tools that give access to the command line and to the desktop. The package also provides a file transfer system and remote execution capabilities. This system also provides a patch manager for Windows.</p>
      <p>The monitoring tool keeps constant track of the resources of each of the devices that have a <b>Lite agent</b> installed. The <b>Professional agent</b> provides much more functionality because technicians can transfer files to these devices and execute maintenance scripts. It is also possible to deploy software on these endpoints.</p>
      <p>The Professional agent grants command line access for investigation. <b>Desktop access</b> is available in two modes – attended and unattended. Whenever a technician wants to access the device, the user of that computer gets <b>a notification</b> and has 60 seconds to allow or block access. This gives the technician remote control. If no response is received, the technician gets full remote desktop access.</p>
      <p>The devices running the Professional agents can be started up and rebooted. The system includes <b>a patch manager</b> for Windows.</p>
      <p>The system also provides a <b>workload automation</b> system that technicians can set up without needing to create any scripts. The service can trigger those processes regularly on a schedule.</p>
      <p>The <strong>LogMeIn Resolve</strong> package includes a <b>Help Desk ticketing</b> service that users can access to request assistance. The ticketing service provides support team managers with automated team and task tracking.</p>
      <h4><strong>Who do we recommend it for?</strong></h4>
      <p>The GoTo RMM system is great for support teams, thanks to its Help Desk ticketing systems. Small businesses might just need the remote access features of the package; in which case, they can use the tool for free. There is also a multi-tenant version for managed service providers.</p>
      <p>There are four plans for LogMeIn Resolve and you sign up for any of them online. The first of these packages is Free. this gives you the remote access functions. You need to go to the paid versions for the RMM features of LogMeIn Resolve. You can try any of these paid plans on a <a href="https://www.goto.com/resolve/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>14-day free trial</strong></a>.</p>

      <p>The security-focused Barracuda RMM package gives your technicians automated services that keep the client’s site safe. These include vulnerability management and system cleanup services. The package includes a patch manager to implement version weaknesses highlighted by the vulnerability scanner. The toolbox in RMM includes <b>remote access</b> and <b>remote desktop</b> utilities plus ongoing monitoring with <b>alerts</b> that enable unattended monitoring.</p>
      <p>As this is specifically an RMM platform, there isn’t a PSA system included in the platform. However, the RMM is able to <b>integrate</b> with a long list of well-known PSA systems. There are some PSA functions included in the RMM. These relate to service plans and ticketing. The platform has a series of service plan templates, which your sales team can offer to prospective customers. When one of these is selected, your contract creation process is a lot easier. Nominating a service plan in the client setup within the Barracuda RMM console automatically triggers <b>service level</b> expectation threshold monitoring.</p>
      <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
      <p>Barracuda RMM is for MSPs and it allows those service providers to offer a range of security tools in addition to system monitoring and management services.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>An agentless monitoring solution that can cover multiple aspects of monitoring and infrastructure. It also works well for any kind of device, including cloud services. It supports multiple monitoring protocols as well, making it suitable for almost any environment.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: AI-powered Anomaly Detection</b></h4>
      <p>A highlight of PRTG is that it uses AI to set the baseline values. Also, it monitors these values for deviations, making it easy to detect potential issues before they impact the wider infrastructure.</p>
      <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
      <p><b>Paessler PRTG</b> is very easy to set up. The tool has a probe unit that will gather information from a site and send that on to the administration console. That console could be in the cloud as part of the SaaS version or on your premises, running on Windows Server.</p>
      <p>The PRTG probe’s network scan sets up all of the system documentation, populating the console. So, this tool sets itself up and can create a multi-site remote monitoring service. The console locates each site on a network map and can also show the performance of connections between them.</p>
      <p>The PRTG package will also monitor cloud platforms. It can track the performance of network devices, servers, and other hardware, such as firewalls. The tool records activity metrics, such as network traffic throughput per link and server resource capacity and utilization. The package has sensors that examine the quality of connections to judge suitability for VoIP.</p>
      <p>This package is able to monitor virtual systems as well as physical hardware. It will monitor hypervisors and containers and link the performance of that middleware to the applications that run on them. The ability to monitor all levels of the stack simultaneously enables rapid root cause analysis when problems arise. The package also provides troubleshooting tools, based on Ping and Traceroute.</p>
      <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
      <p>This is a very flexible package and it will appeal to companies that need to monitor a single site and also corporations that have multiple sites to watch over. The system is even suitable for very small businesses, thanks to its free edition that provides 100 sensors.</p>
      <p>Sign up for the hosted PRTG SaaS package online or download the package and run it on Windows Server. You can start off by accessing a <a href="https://www.paessler.com/download/prtg-download?download=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>30-day free trial</b></a>.</p>

<div class="additional-info">
      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This cloud-based remote support solution offers the flexibility to connect to remote systems through a GUI or the command line, making it well-suited for different environments. You can also use it to connect to Android and iPhone devices and devices with multiple monitors. It has an on-premise deployment option as well.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: Unattended Support</b></h4>
      <p>The standout feature of this tool is its unattended support, which allows technicians to access and manage devices remotely without user interaction. The advantage of this feature is that technicians can fix problems non-intrusively while users are away from their computers.</p>
      <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
      <p><b>Dameware Remote Everywhere</b> is a cloud-hosted system that technicians access through a browser. As such, it doesn’t matter what operating system the technician’s computer is running as long as it has a Web browser. This tool enables access to unattended devices and can start up a remote computer. It also provides remote desktop and remote control functions.</p>
      <p>The remote computer that a technician accesses through this utility can be running <b>Windows</b>, <b>macOS</b>, or <b>Linux</b>. The tool will also access mobile devices running <b>iOS</b> or <b>Android</b>. The system is able to start up, reboot, and shut down remote devices. When the system connects to a remote device, it scans the computer and produces a summary of its attributes and statuses.</p>
      <p>The tool can be used to connect to computers that are in use. In this scenario, the technician gets a view of the desktop of the remote device. The main purpose of remote access is to allow technicians to manage the device rather than just watch it, so the more important conduit of remote desktop is actually <b>remote control</b>.</p>
      <p>A remote control session can include a text or video <b>chat panel</b> to enable the technician and the user to communicate. The remote connection is usually initiated to help the user who has a problem. So, the session can involve the user showing the technician exactly what the problem is or for the technician to fix a problem or to show the user how to use a feature or software package correctly.</p>
      <p>In all cases, the session can be <b>recorded</b> – that feature can be set to run automatically. The recording can be stored and the user can be given access to it.</p>
      <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
      <p>The buyers of Dameware Remote Everywhere would be companies or managed service providers that use an RMM package that doesn’t include a remote access function. This tool will specifically appeal to businesses that prefer SaaS packages and don’t want to host their technician software. Those who would rather host the remote access software themselves should look at <strong>Dameware Remote Support</strong>, which installs on Windows Server.</p>
      <p><b>Dameware Remote Everywhere</b> is one of three options offered by the Dameware brand. The other two are <b>Dameware Remote Support</b> and <b>Dameware Mini Remote Control</b>. These are both on-premises software packages that you install on each technician workstation. You can assess Dameware Remote Everywhere with a <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/dameware-remote-everywhere/registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>14-day free trial</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>The Dameware system runs on the cloud and the technician’s computer can be running Windows, macOS, or Linux.</p>

<div class="additional-info">
      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This unified platform combines multiple aspects of remote monitoring and management into a single pane. Its asset management, endpoint protection, patch management, and backup solutions allow technicians to proactively identify and fix issues.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: AI-powered Session Insights</b></h4>
      <p>The Sessions Insights feature uses AI to automatically document remote support sessions. It can even generate AI summaries after the session to improve performance and diagnostics. This data can also help to set the baseline standards for performance.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><b>TeamViewer Remote Management</b> is backed by a well-established IT support tools provider. This is a relatively new RMM package but experience counts with IT software packages and the background that this company has in remote connection management and account security provides the RMM with a strong foundation.</p>
      <p>The RMM includes a discovery process, which creates an asset inventory. This is available for network devices and endpoints. The discovery process is fueled by <b>SNMP</b>, which repeats constantly, so the asset inventory is kept up to date. The SNMP routine also provides constant device status monitoring.</p>
      <p>The <b>hardware inventory</b> provides the main screen for the monitoring and management functions. All information about a device is attached to its entry in the inventory. This is where you access device information and also status alerts.</p>
      <p>Each discovered endpoint will get an agent installed on it. This enables deeper monitoring functions and scans for software. The service compiles a <b>software inventory</b>, which details the operating system, applications, and version numbers for each. The endpoint agent also enables remote access for maintenance. This can involve the transfer of scripts and there are some standard maintenance tasks such as wake-up, reboot, and temporary file cleaning, built into the package.</p>
      <p>Software management functions in the package include a deployment service that lets an administrator roll out new software to multiple endpoints or onboard a new device with a package of software. The package also includes a <b>patch manager</b> and log collection. These functions are available for endpoints running <b>Windows</b>, <b>macOS</b>, and <b>Linux</b>.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This RMM platform can automate IT tasks, saving time and effort. More importantly, technicians can use scripts to automate repetitive tasks, deploy patches, update software, and more. With these features, they can seamlessly monitor multiple endpoints simultaneously.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus: ConnectWise Sidekick</b></h4>
      <p>This is an AI-driven scripting assistant that uses AI to generate PowerShell scripts. The team can review and approve these scripts, and they will run independently on different devices to automate tasks. At the same time, teams can control their implementation.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ConnectWise Automate</strong> is one of the leading RMM packages for MSPs. A PSA system is also available and that is called ConnectWise Manage. As its name suggests, the big selling point of ConnectWise Automate is the high degree of task automation that it offers. This package provides patch management as well as system monitoring.</p>
      <p>When it comes to remote network management, ConnectWise Automate is an excellent tool for a number of reasons. You can not only <b>take control of sessions remotely</b> but also <b>record videos of remote sessions</b>. Having recordings of videos of remote sessions makes sure that you have evidence that could be needed during an audit.</p>

<p>From a maintenance standpoint, the<b> patch management</b> capabilities of ConnectWise Automate are also very well put together. You can <b>schedule and approve patches automatically</b> and keep the network updated hassle-free.</p>
<p>The platform also offers third-party management current applications for a number of products including <b>Adobe Flash, Adobe Reader XI and DC, Mozilla Firefox, Apple iTunes, Google Chrome, PDFCreator,</b> and more.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>ConnectWise is a very reliable brand and so MSPs will find it very difficult to choose between this package, NinjaOne, Atera, SuperOps, N-able, ManageEngine, Pluseway, and Kaseya. There is no free version, so small businesses probably wouldn’t opt for ConnectWise Automate.</p>
<p>ConnectWise Automate is highly recommended for MSPs looking for a remote monitoring solution that’s easy to use and deploy. However, you will have to contact the company directly for pricing information. The service can be downloaded as <a href="https://www.connectwise.com/platform/automate/trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 14-day free trial</a>.</p>
<div class="ctech-content-on-bk  "><p></p>
<p><b>ConnectWise Automate</b> is a great RMM platform because it provides MSPs with a centralized console to manage their client’s entire IT asset inventory. Everything from autodiscovery to the patch management process is built to help the user monitor a remote network as easily as possible. That includes physical devices and virtual services.</p>
<p>Other features like remote control session recording are also useful for MSPs who want to ensure they’re prepared for auditing scenarios. The product is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>

Pulseway started out as a provider of mobile devices and the Pulseway RMM console can be accessed through a mobile as well as through a desktop. The packages offered by Pulseway provide an option to add on a patch manager and endpoint protection from Bitdefender and Webroot.</p>
      <p>The <b>remote control </b>feature allows you to connect to remote computers with ease. You can connect to a device and interact with the device directly.

<p>The minimum number of endpoints that you can get a license for with Pulseway is 20, so very small businesses won’t go for this package. The service is designed for MSPs but there is also a version for in-house IT departments.</p>
<p>The Pulseway RMM service is charged for by subscription. The price increases with three factors: the number of endpoints covered, the amount of third-party patching, and the number of devices that will be protected by BitDefender. The base price for the service covers 20 endpoints without patching or BitDefender for $32 (23.82) per month when paid annually. All new customers have to undergo a mandatory <b>Advanced Onboarding and Best Practices</b> session, which costs $149.

<h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
<p>The <b>NinjaOne Mobile Device Management</b> system expands the RMM to mobile devices, which is particularly important for businesses that have roaming employees. As managed service providers for a large share of NinjaOne’s customer base, the ability to offer more services improves MSP marketability and so also makes the NinjaOne package more attractive.</p>
<p>While the main functions of the RMM include software deployment, that translates to <b>mobile application management</b> on devices running iOS and Android. That function doesn’t just enable administrators to add or remove approved apps from mobile device but it also enables devices to be locked down, preventing users from installing their own favorite but unapproved apps.</p>
<p>Security features include <b>tracking</b> plus <b>locking</b> and <b>wiping</b> for lost or stolen devices. Mobile content management provides secure delivery of corporate data in files to mobile devices. All of these functions can be managed by the technicians of MSPs on behalf of clients.</p>
<p>In addition to the <b>endpoint management</b> services in the RMM package, you get automated system discovery, documentation, and monitoring. The RMM includes an alerting mechanism that triggers when performance issues arise. This means that technicians can assume that everything is OK if they don’t hear otherwise. The RMM&nbsp; console can be setup to forward alerts by email, SMS, push notification, or Slack, PagerDuty, or Teams messages.</p>
<h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
<p>This system is suitable for managed service providers to look after the mobile devices of their clients and for IT departments that want to manage their own systems in house. The tool is hosted in the cloud and it can manage multiple sites within one account, so it is a good choice for multi-site businesses.</p>
<p>NinjaOne is a<b> cloud-based system</b>, so you sign up for the package at the company’s website rather than downloading any software. You can assess the service with its mobile device management unit with a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/ninjaone-ft-mobile-device-management-software/l/cta/u/2573-1930-2254-0325+62897/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="62897" data-clickid="2573-1930-2254-0325" class="go-link"><b>14-day free trial</b></a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Kandji</strong> system offers a cloud platform for Apple device management that enables you to control the security of devices to protect your company’s data from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>The setup for a group of devices is planned in a system called <b>Blueprints</b>. You can create the same Blueprints for different models of mobile devices. The features that you include in one of these plans relate to the applications and access rights, which sit on top of the operating system and aren’t hardware dependent. You don’t have to apply the same Blueprint to all devices, so you can create different plans for different groups of users.</p>
<p>Functions in the Kandji package include security services, such as configuration locking and vulnerability scanning. The system includes a patch manager that allows each device user to decide when to run the update batch. Administrators can create security monitoring and maintenance automation scripts by assembling workflows through the selection of pre-written templates.</p>
<p>User accounts can be acquired from third-party apps, so you can import the accounts that you have already set up in systems, such as <b>Slack</b> or <b>Okta</b>. This allows you to easily create a single sign-on environment for all of your mobile devices, also coordinating access rights to on-premises Macs.</p>

<p>The Kandji focus on Apple devices is interesting but it reduces the potential customer base for this service. If you have Windows PCs on your site or if you allow BYOD for users with Android phones, you would have to switch to other unified endpoint management tools to watch over them.</p>
<p>You set up an account on the Kandji website and then download <b>an agent</b> onto each of the devices that you enroll in the service, so there are both cloud and on-device elements to this system.

<h3><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h3>
<p>Rippling is a good choice for organizations that need complete control and visibility into the devices that connect to their network. This unified platform can handle everything from device setup to management with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>In particular, its security features are top-notch. It encrypts devices using FileVault and BitLocker and stores the recovery keys in your MDM. Similarly, it deploys SentinelOne for automatic threat defense to protect every endpoint from cyberthreats. It can lock stolen or lost devices and even wipe the sensitive data stored in them to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Besides these security features, its unified view enables you to monitor their health. It also allows your administrators to restrict access in real-time, reassign devices, install updates, and more.</p>
<h3><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h3>
<p>It is highly recommended for MSPs who manage devices for their clients. It also works well for IT teams that have to manage remote devices connecting to their organization’s network.</p>
<p>In all, Rippling is a unified MDM platform that supports Windows and Apple devices with just a few clicks.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This cloud-based platform makes it easy to manage and secure all endpoints, regardless of the device. Since it can control any device, the user experience across all of them is seamless. At the same time, it comes with many powerful features like zero-touch provisioning, threat defense, secure VPN, protection from email threats, app and content management, remote troubleshooting, and more. All these features can be accessed through a single interface. Moreover, it uses AI to create smooth workflows.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus – Rugged Device Automation</b></h4>
      <p>One of the critical challenges is to manage rugged devices used by field service teams, as they can be subject to harsh weather conditions. Ivanti addresses this challenge. It integrates with Zebra, StageNow, and Android Enterprise to automate the firmware and OS on rugged devices. Moreover, IT administrators can set configurations, automate compliance, and verify readiness before the devices are deployed.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><b>Ivanti Neurons for MDM</b> containerizes the delivery of mobile applications, tied together with access to storage space. This means that, when the user logs out, there are no assets of the company left on the device. This prevents business data from being leaked through loss or theft of the device. It also means that users can access the business system from their own devices, keeping personal and work systems completely separate.</p>
<p>Ivanti Neurons doesn’t just apply to mobile devices. It will also provide services to computers running <b>Windows</b> and <b>macOS</b>. Mobile devices can be running <b>iOS</b> or <b>Android</b>. The administrator sets up an application profile that contains a menu of software packages and services. Each user account then has a profile associated with it. The user is then able to self-enroll and access that workspace from any device.</p>
<p>The Ivanti system includes a VPN service. So, by installing an app on a mobile device, the user can open a portal that has a secure connection through to the business’s space on the Ivanti server. This account space can be accessed from anywhere.</p>
<h4><strong>Who do we recommend it for?</strong></h4>
<p>Ivanti Neurons for MDM is a very scalable product. It might be over-complicated for very small businesses, such as owner-run companies that could probably do just as well with a remote desktop system for mobile devices. However, mid-sized and large organizations that have a lot of roaming employees would benefit from this system.</p>
<p>Ivanti doesn’t publish its prices. The cloud-based system is easy to sign up for and the application profile setup process is guided and device-agnostic. You can examine Ivanti Neurons for MDM with a <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/lp/uem/trials/ivanti-neurons-mdm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-day free trial</a>.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This platform combines MDM with Mobile Application Management (MAM) to give you better control over devices and the applications that run on them. Using this tool, you can enforce policies, manage configurations, and improve security by blocking certain apps. It supports a wide range of operating systems as well.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus – Integration with Microsoft Endpoint Manager</b></h4>
      <p>Citrix integrates well with Microsoft Endpoint Manager, so users can secure M365 applications with conditional access through Azure AD. It also offers micro VPN capabilities to Microsoft Intune-aware apps like Microsoft Edge. All these features greatly increase the security of the devices that connect to an organization’s network.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p>The application management version of the Citrix service is called <b>Workspace Premium</b>. This provides a very similar strategy to other options on this list, which containerizes company data. The company-owned devices have broader access to the company network. However, those devices are scanned for security risks, such as malware or insecure apps before they are allowed to connect. So, you get two secure avenues of protecting your network from the risk of malware lateral movement.</p>
<p>The Workspace Premium option operates as a virtual desktop system that is attached to a user account. So, the user can log into a workstation at work and then leave the office and use a mobile device while out on site. That device can be company-owned or user-owned. The delivery of the application profile is managed in the same way regardless of device ownership.</p>
<p>Under the Workspace Premium scenario, the device should have a <b>screen lock</b> and no data is saved to the device. Thus, if the user mislays the device, anyone finding it will be unable to unlock that device and so would not be able to access company data.</p>
<h4><strong>Who do we recommend it for?</strong></h4>
<p>Citrix publishes a price list for its three UEM plans and they are levied per user or per device. This makes the system suitable for use by any size of business. The Citrix Endpoint Management service is based in the cloud and so the administrator can be located anywhere and administer user accounts and devices anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The price for Citrix Endpoint Management varies depending on how many devices are included in the plan. However, Citrix publishes an average price for guidance. For the <b>Stand-Alone</b> plan, which enables direct device management, the price is $4 per user per month or $3 per device per month. The virtualized <b>Workspace Premium</b> system is available in two levels with the higher plan called <b>Workspace Premium Plus</b>. The lower plan costs $18 per user per month and the higher plan is priced at $25 per user per month.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p>While all MDM packages offer onboarding, tracking, locking, and wiping, the provisioning features of <strong>Scalefusion</strong> are outstanding. The ability of this tool to mirror screens of iOS and Android devices for support troubleshooting is also a very useful tool for technicians that other MDMs lack.</p>
<p>The cloud service includes an <b>app storage</b> space so you can create profiles and set up your in-house apps in the Scalefusion App Store. This enables you to define onboarding routines to download apps from the official app stores together with your own apps.</p>
<p>Once devices are up and running, you can contact them through <b>screen mirroring</b> for maintenance issues. The technical support module of Scalefusion integrates with third-party Service Desk utilities to manage tickets.</p>
<p><b>Security measures</b> in the Scalefusion package include device tracking, vulnerability scanning for user-owned devices, and remote locking and wiping for managed devices. It is also possible to host your content on the Scalefusion server and deliver it through a remote access viewer, so files don’t need to be downloaded.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Although the per-device pricing of Scalefusion makes this comprehensive MDM accessible to businesses of all sizes, the technician tools in this system make it particularly interesting to large organizations or managed service providers that maintain teams of support technicians.</p>
<p>Scalefusion is among the few MDMs that support Linux devices as well. They offer a subscription service with four plan levels, all with a rate per device per month. The Starter package costs $2 per device per month. You can get to know the Scalefusion system by accessing a demo. Why not check out Scalefusion for yourself on a <a href="https://app.scalefusion.com/users/sign_up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free trial</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p>The Knox system protects devices from misuse by preventing the user from adding unauthorized apps. It also scans each device according to a policy that you set up. It will prevent it from accessing your network and assets, such as file stores if it is in the wrong location or if some setting presents a security risk. This is a useful tool for enforcing some data protection standards, such as GDPR, which bans access to data from outside a stated country.</p>
<p>Other features in the Knox Manage system include remote access to all managed devices for troubleshooting. This system has a cloud-based console and it is able to manage and access devices anywhere in the world. This makes it a useful system for global businesses that want centralized management for all sites. Device users can travel overseas and the device can still be managed.</p>
<p>The statistics gathering feature of the Knox Manage system can extract contract usage information such as call charges and data plan usage. Bill costs can be limited and devices can be blocked from making high-charge calls, such as to premium numbers.</p>
<h4><strong>Who do we recommend it for?</strong></h4>
<p>Knox Suite is provided by Samsung and it only operates on Samsung devices. All Samsung devices run Android and so you won’t be able to manage iOS devices with this system and there is no associated workstation management package.</p>
<p>Knox Manage isn’t a standalone package. You subscribe to <b>Knox Suite</b>, which includes Knox Manage. Samsung doesn’t provide a price list for Knox Suite but it does offer a <a href="https://www.samsungknox.com/en/solutions/knox-suite#get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90-day free trial</a>.</p>

      <p>This cloud-based platform simplifies onboarding and enrollment.

      <h4><b>Feature in Focus – Automated Enrollment</b></h4>
      <p>A highlight of this tool is its simplified onboarding and enrollment. It integrates with Apple DEP, Android Zero Touch, Samsung Knox, and Windows Autopilot to streamline setup.

      <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
      <p><b>Miradore Mobile Device Management</b> has all of the classic elements of an MDM: mass onboarding, tracking, locking, and wiping, containerized apps, and device encryption. This system is hosted in the cloud, so you don’t need to download and manage any software.

<p>It is difficult to see past the Free edition. However, exciting though it is to get anything for free, there are reasons that people decide to pay for one of the two <b>Premium</b> packages. There are many functions that you can only get in the paid versions.</p>
<p>Examples of utilities that you only get in the paid editions include peripheral device management, drive encryption for workstations, containerization for work apps and data, and automated patching. An important distinction is that the Premium packages provide a <b>unified endpoint management</b> (UEM) service because they include functions for on-premises equipment.</p>
<p>All versions get the same dashboard – there are just a few more tabs available in the Premium plans. The most eye-catching feature of the console is a <b>location map</b>. This pinpoints the location of all your registered devices. Data on your hardware inventory is also presented in charts and graphs on the home page and more detailed information is available in tables on the back pages.</p>
<h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
<p>The Free edition is good for small businesses but remember that you can also get management functions for on-premises devices with the Premium editions, so many SMBs might be tempted to pay. The automation features for software management also provide a lure through to the Premium plans. Large organizations with many roaming users will definitely be interested in the Miradore system.</p>
<p>Miradore Mobile Device Management is easy to sign up for and set up. The <b>Free edition</b> is a good introduction to the service but you can go one better and try the <b>Premium edition</b> on a <a href="https://www.miradore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>14-day free trial</strong></a>. Your package will switch to the Free edition after that if you decide not to pay.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Omnissa Workspace One</strong> offers a sophisticated solution to the management of desktops and mobile devices that can be managed or user-owned. By treating every device as a support system for a Omnissa operating system, the tool standardizes the delivery of applications, attaching the desktop to the user account instead of to the device.</p>
<p>To manage devices, you can <strong>configure policies </strong>that determine restrictions and assign them to devices. You can distinguish between devices and assign them based on the operating system or ownership type. Ownership types are divided into BYO (Bring Your Own) and corporate-owned so you can tell which devices are company-owned and which are owned by employees.</p>
<p>The platform also enables you to <strong>automatically push applications to devices</strong>. This means you can purchase applications in bulk and deploy them efficiently without wasting any time. When it comes to adding new devices, users can enter credentials into an <strong>onboarding workflow</strong> to join the management solution.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Omnissa offers a flexible pricing structure with per-user and per-device options that make this service accessible to businesses of all sizes. The use of virtualization is widespread these days and any system administrator who has already learned how it works will have no problems understanding the Workspace One package.</p>
<p><b>Omnissa Workspace ONE</b> is suitable for enterprises of all sizes and comes with a range of pricing options, due to its seven editions. Prices start at $1.66 (£1.33) per device and $3.00 (£2.40) per user. You can try the <a href="https://www.omnissa.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-day free trial</a> to manage up to 100 devices.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>BlackBerry UEM secures endpoints from chip to cloud using proprietary encryption and containerization. Using this tool, IT teams can manage iOS, Android, Knox, Windows, macOS, BlackBerry, and wearable devices through a single console.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature in Focus – Secure Connect Plus</b></h4>
      <p>Secure Connect Plus module provides on-device end-to-end encryption through a secure IP tunnel. This can be set up for just containerized apps without requiring a full-device VPN. Besides the granular control, this feature ensures the safety of transmitting confidential data.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>BlackBerry UEM</strong> offers a cloud-based service but you can also choose to get it as a software download and host it yourself. Its ability to centralize the management of user and corporate-owned devices is helpful and its ability to include Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS devices is also useful. Unfortunately, like many other options on this list, BlackBerry UEM can’t manage Linux devices.</p>
<p>Managing policies with <strong>BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Management</strong> is very easy. You can <strong>manage policies, users, groups, </strong>and<strong> applications</strong> from the console. Tasks you can complete including assigning apps to user accounts, distributing applications to containers, and configuring native apps.</p>
<p><b>Onboarding new users </b>is also incredibly efficient, with the option to <b>activate new devices</b> via<b> QR code</b> for <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b> users. Groups can also be linked with Active Directory to <b>automatically onboard new users</b>. There is also the option to set aside work activities from personal ones with multiple activation types such as Work and Personal devices and Work Only.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The BlackBerry presentation for its UEM stresses the system’s suitability for use with IoT devices. However, it is also designed to manage desktops and mobile devices. Although other systems don’t put that capability in their headline, many of the packages on this list have equal IoT management capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Management </strong>is a solid MDM solution that’s available on-premises and in the cloud. To view the pricing information you need to request a quote from the sales team directly. You can <a href="https://account.blackberry.com/register/trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start the free trial</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><b>SureMDM</b> is able to manage mobile devices running Android and iOS. It is also able to track wearable tech and VR equipment. However, this tool can manage devices running Windows, macOS, and Linux, which extends the abilities of the system to desktops, making it a <b>Unified Endpoint Management</b> (UEM) system.</p>
<p>Fleet devices are managed through a mobile app. This app provides a portal. Think of it as an app locker – tapping on it opens a folder that includes icons for all your corporate apps. This is <b>Mobile Application Management </b>(MAM) strategy and it is applied to user-owned devices through containerization.</p>
<p>The containerized version works in the same way as the app locker. Users tap on the app and get prompted to log in. A <b>single sign-on </b>mechanism in the app then flows through authorization to all of the apps in the opened folder. Any data that gets accessed through one of the apps in the folder cannot be saved to the device because the container provides a floating operating system that neither apps nor users can break through.</p>
<p>The <b>Kiosk Mode</b> is also implemented through containerization, only this configuration possesses the device entirely. Thus, settings for keyboard commands and conditions such as WiFi access are blocked unless they are specified within the container’s operating system. Thus, it is possible to tightly control the functions of the device that a user can access while still enabling remote management down to the device’s operating system. This technique can also be allied to VR and wearable devices.</p>
<p><b>Device security</b> features in the SureMDM package include tracking, locking, and wiping. The tool is able to track devices all over the world and its administrator interface is available in multiple languages, including French, Spanish, and German as well as English.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The per-device charging structure of this system makes it accessible to businesses of all sizes. Some higher functions are available as paid add-ons, which makes right-sizing provision easier. There is a multi-tenant account version, called SureMDM Hub for managed service providers.</p>
<p>You can check out this MDM system by accessing a 30-day free trial of <a href="https://suremdm.42gears.com/console/v3/#/user/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SureMDM</a> or <a href="https://www.42gears.com/free-trial-selection/suremdm-hub-free-trial/?pname=38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SureMDM Hub</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SOTI MobiControl</strong> is able to support IoT devices and desktops as well as mobile devices and it is focused on enforcing security on corporate-owned devices.</p>
<p>When monitoring devices users can choose between <strong>remote viewing</strong> or <strong>remote control </strong>to take control of devices for a more hands-on approach to performance issues. There is also a <strong>chat</strong> that enables the administrator to communicate with the end-user of the device.</p>
<p>The software can also be used for mobile content management to<b> secure files </b>and <b>web content</b>. Through the <b>SOTI Hub app,</b> you can upload <b>Microsoft Office files </b>and determine which users have access to the resources. The application is very useful for managing access to files to ensure that only relevant employees can view sensitive information.</p>
<p>The <strong>application management capabilities</strong> of<strong> SOTI MobiControl</strong> are also very useful. Administrators can control what applications are permitted through<strong> blacklists </strong>and<strong> whitelists</strong>. Blacklisting non-work applications help ensure that teams stay productive.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>This system aims to manage corporate-owned devices with strong security and data transfer performance optimization. It is a good choice if you often have problems connecting to devices in areas with poor signal quality.</p>
<p>During our testing, we identified the following pros and cons related to SOTI MobiControl.</p>
<p><strong>SOTI MobiControl</strong> is recommended for teams looking for MDM solutions with clear connected visibility with remote control capabilities.

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Cisco Meraki</strong> is a very sophisticated virtual network system that, despite its underlying complexity, presents a simple network in your management console. You can assign IP addresses in a single address space across your enterprise’s many sites and treat mobile devices as part of that structure.</p>
<p>Underpinning the MDM is a secure communication channel that is encrypted by AES with a 256-bit key. The app communication is protected by a VPN, which is applied on a per-app basis.</p>
<p>Configuration can be varied according to device type, user profile, or ownership model. These groups of devices can be configured in bulk, but there is always the possibility of individual configuration.<strong> Users with their own devices can enroll to get included in the network</strong>. The delivery method for apps and data files is called Backpack. The central administrator creates a bundle of files and then sends out access permissions to groups, individuals, or the entire network. These bundles will go out to user-owned devices once they have enrolled and been included in a user group.</p>
<p>Lost or stolen mobile phones can have all of their rights revoked and can be locked or wiped remotely. <b>Meraki automatically tracks mobile plan usage</b>, so excessive activity can be identified from live reports and stolen devices can be cut off from the phone and data services immediately.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Large multi-site businesses would get the most out of the Cisco Meraki service. It is also a good tool for securing the inclusion of user-owned devices by delivering apps and data outside of the secure network in containers.</p>
<p>Cisco Meraki Systems Manager is a robust, cloud-based MDM solution that simplifies device management across iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows devices, offering strong security and scalability for businesses. Its seamless integration with Meraki networking devices and intuitive dashboard make it ideal for large, multi-site organizations, though it may require dedicated hardware and be less user-friendly for smaller setups.</p>

</a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-460590" class="wp-caption-text">The devices associated with a network.</figcaption></figure>
<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Jamf Now</strong> is equally competent at managing corporate-owned devices and BYOD. The service is a good choice because of its ability to secure devices and prevent lost or misplaced mobiles from risking data disclosure.</p>
<p>The setup process for devices revolves around “<strong>blueprints</strong>.” Each blueprint represents a standard configuration. You can create groups of devices and allocate a different blueprint to each. Configuration of those groups of devices can then be commanded, setting up all of them in bulk.</p>
<p>An alternative method for device inclusion is the <strong>enrolment process</strong>. This requires a device owner to create an account for the network by accessing a custom enrollment page. Once signup is complete, the configuration of the device initiates, giving user-owned devices the same level of security accorded to business-owned devices.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring of devices can be automated, giving you alerts when risk conditions occur, such as jailbreaking or the installation of unauthorized software.<b> It is possible to display a full inventory of devices on your network in the dashboard</b>. Details include spare storage capacity, a list of installed apps, and the serial number of the device.</p>
<p>Each device can be given a passcode centrally, and it is possible to use two-factor authentication with Jamf Now. <strong>You can activate a lost mode, which will lock the device and cause it to signal you its location</strong>. You can also wipe devices remotely.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The big restriction in the Jamf Now service is that it only manages iOS. If you are prepared to have multiple device management tools running in parallel, you could integrate Jamf Now into your toolset. However, that strategy doesn’t make sense when there are other competent tools available that offer more operating systems.</p>
<p>Jamf Now is an interesting system and the <strong>free service for three devices</strong> is very tempting for sole traders, partnerships, and startups on a tight budget. The limitation of the service to just iOS devices may make this option too limited for your business.</p>

          <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>ManageEngine ADManager Plus</strong>&nbsp;will read in all of your AD records and from then on, you use the ManageEngine system to run your access rights rather than Active Directory. The system automatically updates your AD domains behind the scenes.</p>
          <p>Customers of ManageEngine ADManager Plus have several implementation options. The software for the system can be downloaded and installed on <b>Windows Server</b>. It is also available for automated installation on an <b>Amazon AWS</b> account or on <b>Microsoft Azure</b>. If you choose the cloud services version, you can still manage all of your on-premises Active Directory instances with it.</p>
          <p>Your regular Active Directory management tasks, such as user accounts and groups management and device permissions creation can all be automated. This <b>coordinates new accounts</b> so you can pass them through to other instances. It will identify abandoned accounts and inactive devices to enable you to clean up the records in your AD instances.</p>
          <p>The ManageEngine service also helps you with <b>Active Directory administration tasks</b>, such as backup, restore, and replication.</p>
          <p>If your business needs to comply with specific data protection standards, such as <b>HIPAA</b> or <b>SOX</b>, you can indicate this in the settings of ADManager Plus and the system will be adjusted to ensure that you always remain in compliance. It also automatically produces all of the reports you need for those standards in the correct formats.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>Small businesses will appreciate the Free edition, which is limited to managing 100 AD objects. There are also two paid editions that cater to mid-sized, single-site companies, and large, multi-location enterprises. The software runs on Windows Server and the package is also available as a service on the AWS and Azure marketplaces.</p>
          <p>There are three editions of ADManager Plus: <b>Free</b>, <b>Standard</b>, and <b>Professional</b>. The Free edition is limited to managing one domain.

           <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
           <p><strong>ManageEngine ADAudit Plus</strong> is a user behavior analytics tool that combats insider threats and account takeover opportunities. The system helps you tighten up Active Directory entries, for example by identifying abandoned accounts. It then logs the activities of each user for data loss prevention. The package also logs changes to AD records.</p>
           <p>ADAudit Plus doesn’t just operate on Active Directory. AD is the linchpin of the whole system but this is really an <b>activity tracking </b>service that particularly identifies the activities on sensitive data stores, so it is a data protection auditing tool that integrates Active Directory rather than being a system that audits Active Directory.</p>
           <p>The system records every login action and particularly <b>failed login attempts</b>, an excess of which could show account takeover attempts. The service also looks for sudden changes in behavior by a user in their access to different systems and particularly file storage. These unexpected changes in activities can also indicate <b>account takeover</b>.</p>
           <p>Other data protection measures in the ADAudit Plus package include a <b>file integrity monitor</b> (FIM), which encrypts sensitive files individually but automatically decrypts them for access by authorized users. The ADAudit Plus service also includes a removable storage media control system that can prevent copying to USBs.</p>
           <p>Clearly, analysis of the user accounts and permissions structure is part of the requirements for ADAudit Plus and the service also records all actions by administrators within the Active Directory environment. The log files that the service creates are also <b>protected against tampering</b>.</p>
           <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
           <p>This system is important for businesses that need to implement data protection standards. The package is good for compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and FISMA among other standards. There is a free edition of the package. However, this is only able to operate on data collected during the free trial of the full, paid package.</p>
           <p>The software for ADAudit Plus runs on <b>Windows Server</b>. Alternatively, you can get a cloud-hosted version on <b>Azure Marketplace</b> or <b>AWS Marketplace</b>. ManageEngine offers the system in three editions. The first of these is <b>Free</b>. Which logs activities on up to 25 workstations. The two paid editions are called <b>Standard</b> and <b>Professional</b>. The higher plan, Professional, adds on features such as GPO change tracking, “before and after” comparisons on AD changes, and account lockout analysis. You can assess ADAudit Plus with a fully functional <strong><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/manageengine-active-directory-admin-adap-ad-administration-management-tools/l/cta/u/8017-8765-2206-5792+337078/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1" data-postid="337078" data-clickid="8017-8765-2206-5792" class="go-link">30-day free trial</a></strong>.</p>

          <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>SolarWinds Access Rights Manager</strong> is designed to work with Active Directory. The service provides a new front end for your AD domains and it can front for multiple instances in one console. The tool provides a method for bulk actions, such as uploads and updates and it audits accounts to remove security weaknesses.</p>
          <p>The service analyzes the entries in AD and categorizes resources <b>according to sensitivity</b>. That identification allows for stronger protection measures for the more important assets. The system also tracks account usage and <b>identifies abandoned accounts</b> that need to be deleted.</p>
          <p>The SolarWinds system introduces a degree of <b>automation</b> that is not present in the native AD interface. It includes role-specific templates that quickly set up accounts in bulk. An alternative account management system is available through a self-service portal, which allows users to perform mundane account management functions, such as resetting passwords.</p>
          <p>The Access Rights Manager provides <b>insider threat analysis</b>. It performs a security assessment of device permissions and accounts group policies to highlight loose security and it recommends better account management strategies. A system of <b>role-specific account templates</b> helps you standardize provisioning and this can also be applied in bulk to existing accounts to tighten up security. System auditing and activity logging processes help you confirm optimal security settings.</p>
          <p>The SolarWinds system identifies the most important <b>log messages</b> coming out of Active Directory and it can manage their storage according to the requirements of data protection standards. The SolarWinds system also provides the constant activity monitoring required by those standards. It includes intrusion detection functions with <b>rapid account suspension abilities</b>.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This software package runs on Windows Server and if you are running Active Directory, you certainly will have that operating system on your site. The package can also manage Azure AD instances. The system is suitable for use by large organizations that have many AD domains.</p>

          <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>Specops Active Directory Janitor</strong> is an auditor for Active Directory domains. IT will identify abandoned accounts and weak password security policies. The system also looks around your network to identify access systems that might not be managed within AD and advises to integrate their management with the Active Directory system.</p>
          <p>Other tools on this list give you everything you need for your Active Directory management duties in one console. Not everyone is comfortable with that strategy. Specops took a different approach and built <b>individual tools</b> for different AD administration tasks.</p>
          <p>This tool <b>scans the permissions structure</b> of AD and identifies loose security, dead accounts, and orphaned accounts. These scenarios are security risks because badly tracked and unused accounts provide convenient carriers for hackers. The tool produces a report and lets you decide how you can tidy up the system.</p>
          <p>This service includes <b>autodiscovery</b> functions, so it sets itself up. Not only does it scan through the AD database, but it searches the network to confirm the existence of listed devices. The automation features extend to automatic clean-up actions. However, you decide whether those processes will kick in automatically.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This tool is a good package for systems that have been badly managed. It provides a thorough assessment of access credential security and helps you bring all ARM issues into compliance. The system is also useful for ongoing checks but it will never come up with as many issues as it discovers on its first scan of your system.</p>
          <p>Active Directory Janitor is on-premises software for installation on <b>Windows Server</b>.</p>

          <p><strong>Netwrix Auditor for Active Directory</strong> is a similar package to ManageEngine ADAudit Plus. It can be used to tune your ARM to specific standard requirements and then will produce compliance reporting. The tool tracks user actions, such as logon activity and failed logons. This will detect insider threats and account takeovers.</p>
          <p>This package focuses on the activity of administrators within the Active Directory environment. It reports on all login activity into Active Directory and <b>lists all changes</b> made. This doesn’t provide you with automated rollback of changes. However, it gives a record of alterations and if you didn’t make those changes, you know where to go to put things back to normal yourself.</p>
          <p>The system supervises a range of Active Directory implementations, including Azure AD, Microsoft Exchange Server, Windows 365, and the Windows File Server system.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This package will be particularly useful for businesses that need to comply with PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, GLBA, FISMA/NIST, and CJIS. Even if you don’t need to follow a particular standard, this tool is useful for user tracking and account protection. You will be able to identify abandoned accounts and see account activity that could be malicious.</p>
          <p>This is <b>a community-supported system</b>, which might be a problem if your corporate policy only allows you to deploy professionally supported software. However, don’t move on just yet because there is also <b>a paid version</b> of Netwrix Auditor for Active Directory and that is fully supported by the Netwrix Help Desk.</p>
          <p>The paid version has automatic tailoring to a list of <b>data security standards</b>. These include SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST, FERPA, GLBA, FISMA, CJIS, NERC CIP, and ISO/IEC 27001. This service also includes an interface for the backup and restore functions of Active Directory. The restore function can be triggered by accidental or malicious unauthorized changes to AD records.</p>

          <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>GroupID</strong> is a product of Imanami, which was recently taken over by Netwrix, so technically, this is the second Netwrix tool on our list. This is an Active Directory manager and focuses on the definition of user groups and mapping to teams. The system allows technicians to delegate the management of AD groups to the business managers who are in charge of each of the real-world teams that those groups represent.</p>
          <p>This system demonstrates all user accounts per group and also shows all device permissions, enabling <b>cross-management</b> of these two vital elements of Active Directory administration. The GroupID system shows you ways to create more groups so that you can implement a more finely nuanced access rights system.</p>
          <p>Many administrators are reluctant to create many user groups because it increases administration time. However, the clarity of the <b>management interface</b> offered by GroupID reduces that distraction, making it possible to manage a better grade of security policy.</p>
          <p>GroupID includes <b>automated onboarding routines</b> and systems to enable user accounts to change groups, which caters to scenarios where employees move to different positions within the organization. The tool integrates with an HR directory to improve role and permissions management.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This service doesn’t cover all aspects of Active Directory administration and management, just the definition and maintenance of groups and the user accounts allocated to them. The ability to bring team managers into the task of managing domain records is a good idea because it removes communication errors between staff.</p>

        <p><strong>Adaxes</strong> is a management interface that will unify the administration of multiple domains. This is a similar service to that offered by ManageEngine ADManager Plus and SolarWinds Access Rights Manager. The service will provide a single console to manage Active Directory instances that could be on-premies, for Microsoft 365, for Exchange, or Azure AD.</p>
        <p>The Adaxes system not only supervises Active Directory, but it also has its own strategy for <b>optimizing role-based access control</b>. It examines the existing structure of your Active Directory environment and indicates where adjustments can be made to bring it into line with the Adaxes plan. So, this system provides you with a guided <b>Active Directory management strategy</b>.</p>
        <p>Moving on to day-to-day tasks and new user provisioning, Adaxes provides <b>workflows</b> for jobs and includes automated account creation services. Accounts are easy to adjust and delete as well.</p>
        <p>The console for this system is delivered from your own servers as a website and can be made available to any standard Web browser. The screens for the dashboard are customizable and they offer performance monitoring data as well as alerts for system security sweeps, access attempts, and unauthorized changes.</p>
        <p>Another web interface available to subscribing businesses is the <b>self-service portal</b>. This can be white-labeled and customized and it allows users to perform some of their access admin needs themselves. This reduces the load on your Help Desk team.</p>
        <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
        <p>This tool competes directly with its ManageEngine and SolarWinds rivals in the market for mid-sized and large businesses. The tool will coordinate replication and any changes you make to AD records through the Adazes interface get copied through to the backing Active directory instances.</p>
        <p>Adaxes installs on <b>Windows Server</b> and is sold on a perpetual license. Support contracts are written annually.

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><b>JSCAPE MFT </b>offers SFTP, FTPS, and SCP for secure transfers. It is also able to move files through HTTP, HTTPS, and WebDAV. The client for the file transfer utility is Web based and hosted together with the server. The client can be accessed by users who have been granted usage rights in the corporate access rights manager, which also provides file access authorization.</p>
  <p>The secure file transfer system is able to perform internal transfers and invite uploads or downloads for external users. The MFT package can also manage corporate syncing policy and organize local non-secure transfers, such as <b>TFTP</b> for network device configuration image movements.</p>
  <p>The JSCAPE package includes a plugin for Microsoft Outlook. This limits the files that can be accessed for attachments. For example, the tool can limit access to a specific folder. Another feature in the service is the ability to transfer <b>EDI</b> messages with AS2 and OFTP2.</p>
  <p>JSCAPE has created a fast file transfer system, called <b>Accelerated File Transfer Protocol </b>(AFTP). This isn’t a secure protocol but it can be used to move large files within the organization to a DMZ for distribution to outsiders.</p>

      <h4>Comparitech SupportScore</h4>
      <p>While the company’s products are well-respected, Files.com’s size may limit its ability to provide a rapid, hands-on product support for every customer. There may be self-support documentation available to customers, but this is not visibly available to non-customers. These limitations resulted in Files.com receiving a <strong>60/100 SupportScore.&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Note that this is not a reflection of Files.com as a product. We continue to find Files.com provides a solid SFTP service, but it may be better suited to companies that have adequate technical skills among their IT teams without much need of extra support to launch and maintain their software implementation.</p>
      <p>Be aware that you may have longer wait times to troubleshoot potential issues. If you are shortlisting Files.com as your vendor, we recommend asking specifically about its customer and product support to verify if this is a good fit for your needs.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p>The <strong>Files.com</strong> service encourages you to upload files onto the provider’s cloud platform and email out links instead of sending out copies. The advantage of this strategy is that it allows your company and each individual user to maintain control over how those files can be accessed and revoking permissions means that the former recipient doesn’t get to keep a copy of the file. All transfers, storage, and viewing are protected by encryption.</p>
  <div class="jsx-524183946 diff-row" tabindex="0" role="row" data-index="2" data-known-size="48" data-item-index="2"><strong><span class="jsx-2685123126 diff-chunk diff-chunk-equal">Files.com <span class="jsx-2685123126 diff-chunk diff-chunk-inserted">can operate with FTP and SFTP in three different ways.</span></span></strong></div>
  <div class="jsx-524183946 diff-row" tabindex="0" role="row" data-index="8" data-known-size="160" data-item-index="8">
<p>Files.com itself can operate as an inbound FTP and SFTP server, allowing you and your users to connect to your Files.com account via SFTP. This allows you to use SFTP to access any portion of your Files.com account, even folders that are syncing to other providers, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Box, Dropbox, Wasabi, etc.</p>
<p>You can Mount an external FTP or SFTP site directly into Files.com as a folder. Files.com acts as an FTP or SFTP Client in this context, making that SFTP site available via the Files.com web interface, API, SDKs, and even other inbound SFTP connections.</p>
<p>You can configure a scheduled Sync, where Files.com will synchronize its copy of a folder or folders on a one-way or two-way basis with the external FTP or SFTP server.</p>
</div>
<p>Businesses can use Files.com as a pass-through when sending files to outsiders, storing a backup on the server in case of loss. It can also be used as a <b>collaboration file storage</b> – enabling several users to access and edit a document. Given that files can be left on the Files.com server, it can also be used as <b>a backup service</b> for important system files.</p>
<p>Files.com supports Single Sign On (SSO), Two Factor Authentication (2FA), Data Locality, Data Retention Management, Management Delegation, Audit Trails, Non-Repudiation, HIPAA, GDPR, and everything else needed for a secure and compliant Cloud Managed File Transfer solution.</p>
<p>The security offered by Files.com enhances transfer protocols because it enforces <b>two-factor authentication</b> for file access and uses the typical SFTP -strength protection for files during transmission.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Although there is a requirement for a minimum number of user accounts, which is five, the per-user charging of Files.com is a very scaleable service that is accessible to businesses of all sizes. The integration of the Microsoft 365 productivity suite and collaboration features means that this is a good cloud drive option for distributed teams and virtual offices.</p>
<p>During our testing, we identified the following pros and cons related to Files.com.</p>
<p>Files.com is a subscription service with a charge levied, per user, per month. The service is offered in three plan levels: <b>Starter</b>, <b>Power</b>, and <b>Premier</b>. The Starter plan requires a minimum of 5 users and provides a throughput of 1 TB per month. The Power plan includes a data throughput limit of 5 TB per month and requires a minimum of 15 users. The top plan, Premier, offers a data throughput capacity of 5 TB per month caters to at least 25 users.

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ExaVault</strong> is a very similar service to Files.com and you will have trouble devising between the two. Both offer secure transfers and storage and promote discretionary file sharing. The tools also both include an integration with Microsoft 365. In the field of workflow automation, both systems can be used with Zapier to create third-party orchestration with other applications.</p>
      <p>The ExaVault service is flexible and it can be put to a range of uses. You can use ExaVault with any secure <b>FTP client</b> and activate process automation features in the platform to create flow through for authorized transfers. The system can also be used as a primary store of business documents because it promotes <b>collaboration</b> through a file sharing mechanism. The service is offered in packages that provide different volumes of <b>cloud storage space</b>.</p>
      <p>Employees can cut network and internet traffic by uploading a file for <b>distribution</b> and then emailing out links to the file instead of transferring many copies. The link access system provides stronger permission controls and also includes activity tracking.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p>This system is a high-end tool and not just a file transfer tool. The package includes both a server and a client, which are hosted together – users access the client remotely. The <b>Cerberus FTP Server</b> offers many more protocol options than just SFTP and FTPS and it can implement automated transfers.</p>
  <p>The Cerberus FTP Server system offers a <b>secure environment</b>. Users need to log in to use the client and credentials are validated against <b>Active Directory</b>. It is also possible to implement a single sign-on environment by connecting to <b>Okta</b>.</p>
  <p>There are <b>three plans</b> for the Cerberus package and higher editions, while being more expensive, provide more features. The top plan includes a performance monitoring service and also automated network monitoring. This service can identify rogue transfers. All plans include activity logging.</p>
  <p>As well as user access, the tool offers opportunities for <b>task automation</b>. It is possible to set up virtual folders and group directories, which open up the options for file sharing and automated file transfers. The FTP server can be used to back up file download features in websites and it can also receive files uploaded through a Web interface.</p>

      <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
      <p>SFTP To Go is easy to use, as you can transfer and share files through its intuitive web portal. There are no complicated processes involved, making it ideal for all users, regardless of their technical knowledge.</p>
      <p>One of the highlights of SFTP To Go is its focus on security. It offers two kinds of authentication – accounts and credentials. Accounts are members of an organization who are authorized to perform certain activities on a file. This access is controlled at the organizational level. Credentials, on the other hand, are used to perform authorized activities alone on a file. These credentials can be for a specified time only. Such secure features reduce the chances of unauthorized access.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>FileZilla Server</strong> is part of a free suite of file transfer services along with a companion client utility. You aren’t limited to using these two tools together, you can use any other FTP client with the FileZilla Server and any other FTP server with the FileZilla Client. FileZilla is easy to use and is great for ad-hoc secure transfers.</p>
  <p>The layout is very intuitive to navigate. Under the <b>Quickconnect</b> bar, you can view a <b>message log </b>that gives you status information on file transfers throughout your environment. Under that section, the left column shows<b> local files and directories</b>, and the right column<b> displays files and directories on the server </b>you’re connected to. Being able to compare the two side-by-side makes it easier to know what transfers you need to complete.</p>
  <p><b>Drag-and-drop</b> allows you to add files into <b>FileZilla</b> to transfer. You can<b> view a list of files being transferred </b>in the<b> Queued files </b>section at the bottom of the screen. If you want to cap the number of transfers taking place then you can<b> configure transfer speed limits</b>.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server</strong> is a great choice, above all because it is free. Many free tools are not very good but this one comes from SolarWinds, which is a trusted and well-supported provider. This tool also enforces user credentials for access and provides strong encryption, so it is suitable for use on maintenance tasks that might include the transfer of mission-critical settings. It can also be used to protect the transfers of sensitive files up to 4 GB in size.</p>
  <p>To control access to your files, you can <b>create user accounts</b>. Configuring user authentication details lets you determine who can access your files. You can add new users by entering a <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> in the <b>Users</b> section. The process is simple, so it’s easy for new users to start managing employee access to the server.</p>
  <p>If you want additional security, then you can limit the operations that are permitted on the server. You can select a list of operations that the server will allow including <b>Upload File, Download File, Delete File, Rename File, List Directory Contents, Create Directory, Delete Directory,</b> and more. You can also choose what protocols you will allow.</p>
  <p>SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server provides you with everything you need to start managing SFTP and SCP file transfers with a simple user interface.</p>
  <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
  <p>This secure file transfer system can have many applications. However, you will find that this is the utility that you have been looking for to distribute configuration files to remote devices. The system can be used as a secure replacement for TFTP when updating firmware on IoT devices and the system is able to interface with iOS.</p>
  <p>During our testing, we identified the following pros and cons related to SFTP/SCP.</p>
  <p>Buyers of the <b>SolarWinds Engineer’s Toolset</b> won’t need to download this free SFTP/SCP Server because it is already bundled into the package. The Engineer’s Toolset includes more than 60 network administration utilities, such as a <b>Configuration Manager</b> and an I<b>P Address Manager</b>. This package is available for a <strong><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/free-sftp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">14-day free trial</a></strong>.</p>
  <div class="ctech-content-on-bk  "><p></p>
<p><strong>SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server</strong> offers a complete SFTP solution that can fully support most enterprises. The multiple file transfers offered by the tool and the 4GB limit is more than ample to get you started.</p>
<p>While the software doesn’t have a fancy GUI or tons of bells and whistles, this is an advantage for new users, because it makes the system easier to navigate. SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server is only available for Windows.</p>

      <h4>Comparitech SupportScore</h4>
      <p>Our analysis of this company resulted in a <strong>SupportScore of 21/100.</strong> Syncplify clean look and feel make the company appear bigger than it is. However, it’s small size will likely result in limited 1-on-1 customer support. If your businesses needs product onboarding, implementation help, or ongoing and regular support, you may not be well-served here.</p>
      <p>That is note a mark against the company’s product. As Syncplify grows, this may change. For now, this tool is best for companies with highly skilled IT teams that can take full advantage of Syncplify’s broad self-service documentation.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p>The HIPAA-compliant <strong>Syncplify Server</strong> is a useful tool for secure transfers of sensitive data. You can also use this system to receive a large number of files simultaneously, which means that it is an ideal system for large organizations that regularly expect files from members of the public of a business association. The concurrent file transfer limit of 5,000 goes far beyond the requirements of a single business for internal use.</p>
  <p>One of the features that makes<b> Syncplify Server</b> stand apart from many other competitors is its extensibility. You can <b>create custom scripts</b> to add new functions. Scripts give you complete control over the file management process enabling better integration with your daily operations.</p>

      <h4>Comparitech SupportScore</h4>
      <p>CrushFTP is one of the smallest FTP software providers on our list. As such, this company earned <strong>15/100 SupportScore</strong> in our analysis of its customer and product support capabilities. While this is not an indication or poor product quality, it does mean that you may need to operate this software independently without the assistance or support of CrushFTP should you run into issues.</p>
      <p>The company supplements this with a large amount of self-service documentation, which could be exactly what your company needs. If not, we recommend going with a larger provider. Nevertheless, if possible, contact someone at CrushFTP to learn more about how it provides support to existing customers.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>CrushFTP</strong> is a cross between the mediated file transfer platforms such as Files.com and ExaVault, and managed file transfer systems, such as SolarWinds Serv-U. This hosted service lets you create interface forms that validate users and allow self-service of files. It also enables you to create access to files through a Web-based viewer that eliminates the need for the transfer of data.</p>
  <p>To manage user access, you can <b>create custom forms for users</b> when they visit your site. For example, you can ask for additional information about file uploads. Users also have the option to retain control over files or files and enable others to have temporary access. <b>Temporary access</b> can be <b>sent out via email </b>and remains available for a specific time period. However, administrators can still step in to control the type of content that can be shared and for the amount of time if needed.</p>
  <p>For security, CrushFTP includes<b> automated banning</b>. CrushFTP monitors connection patterns and<b> bans IPs that hammer connection, command, or password settings</b>. Blocking malicious IPs reduces your exposure to bad actors and stops them from interacting with your server.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>Rebex Tiny SFTP Server</strong> is a free tool. It is a lightweight and secure file transfer utility that is ideal for securing the movements of small files. As the name suggests, this is a secure replacement for the Tiny File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), which is usually used for transferring configuration files to network and IoT devices.</p>

<p>The tool is ideal for enterprises that need a simple SFTP solution rather than a complete SFTP server. While Rebex Tiny SFTP Server is an excellent tool it is important to note that it stores passwords in cleartext.</p>
<p>That means you can see passwords on the main server form, making Rebex Tiny SFTP Server inappropriate for users looking for a secure solution. It’s free for personal and commercial use. You can <a href="https://www.rebex.net/tiny-sftp-server/#download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">download the software for free</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Network administrators are probably using TFTP to move configuration images at the moment and should replace that facility with Rebex Tiny SFTP Server. The time has gone when network administrators could rely on the security of a private network. You should ensure strong file encryption on all of your file movements even within the confines of your LAN.</p>
<p>During our testing, we identified the following pros and cons related to Rebex Tiny SFTP Server.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>ManageEngine ADManager Plus</strong> offers a more useable interface for Active Directory management that the native AD administration screens. Once you start up this tool, you won’t need to access the basic AD screens again because ManageEngine flows through all actions that you perform in the ADManager Plus screens to the Active Directory system.</p>
  <p>With regards to reports, <b>ManageEngine ADManager Plus </b>can be used to automate the report generation process. This means that you can generate reports without having to do everything manually. This not only makes Active Directory management more convenient but also reduces the time that would be wasted on navigating the Active Directory program.</p>
  <p>It is also worth mentioning that <strong>ManageEngine ADManager Plus</strong> is a tool you should consider for regulatory compliance as well. If you need to complete a compliance audit for SOX or HIPAA, the ability to manage your Active Directory data and generate reports is invaluable.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><b>NinjaOne</b> provides Active Directory management within its main console. This means that technicians don’t need to log in remotely to each AD domain. Functions within the tool enable password resets, user account permissions changes, enabling and disabling of accounts, password policy enforcement, and group allocation. The AD management system is included in the price of the RMM package.</p>
<p>During testing, NinjaOne Endpoint Management provided high visibility into the health and performance of an organization’s Active Directory Domain Controllers (ADDCs), alongside all other managed devices. NinjaOne automatically detected if a server was a primary or secondary domain controller and managed to pull in AD user data which made for more efficient, single-pane management. NinjaOne enabled our admins to quickly and easily access the complete list of ADDC user accounts, see details on each account, and take necessary actions (i.e., disable account, unlock user, reset password, etc.) without having to remote into a device.</p>

<p>The full NinjaOne service gives technicians <b>automated monitoring</b> services for remote systems with alerts for performance problems. This means that it isn’t necessary to allocate a technician to watch the system monitoring screens because staff will be drawn to the service by a notification if they are needed. This feature enables a small team of technicians to monitor many systems simultaneously.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><b>SentinelOne Singularity Ranger AD</b> is a remnant of a wider security package from SentinelOne that was called Ranger Pro. This is the only part of the Ranger range that is still available. It audits Active Directory domains and checks for risk factors, such as abandoned accounts and flabby password policies.</p>
<p>The SentinelOne system can be run on your own server, sitting alongside Active Directory on <b>Windows Server</b>. You can also opt to get it as a SaaS package on the SentinelOne cloud system. In either configuration, you can use the tool to monitor Active Directory on premise and Azure AD in the cloud.</p>
<p>The auditing functions of Ranger AD operate continuously, which makes it a vulnerability analysis service. The live cycle also tracks the activities of each account in the AD list. This includes factors such as elevated privileges, used for accessing the settings of infrastructure. The monitoring cycle extends to attack monitoring.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Ranger AD is both a preventative security system and a live attack monitoring service. The package can be used as part of an account takeover or insider threat analysis system. The tool is reasonably priced and is suitable for use by any size or type of company that deploys Active Directory for its access rights manager.</p>
<p>SentinelOne Singularity Ranger AD offers good value for money because it provides both account auditing services and live attack monitoring.

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Specops Command</strong> provides a scripting system to manage users and devices. This is a great maintenance task automation feature that can implement tasks overnight when all of the users are out of the office.</p>
<p>What makes the scripting feature interesting is that you can not only write your own scripts but import them straight from a file as well. In addition, you can schedule when a script will be executed. This gives you an additional measure of automation that allows you to take a step back.</p>
<p>Not wanting to be a one trick pony, <strong>SpecOps Command </strong>also allows you to <strong>generate reports</strong> as well. These reports are web-based and designed around script feedback. The advantage here is you can take extra time to analyze the feedback from what you’ve done.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Recovery Manager for Active Directory</strong> is a backup system for AD. This tool is able to provide object-level recovery, restoring depleted or altered objects while the system is still active.</p>
<p>With <b>Recovery Manager for Active Directory</b> you can <b>restore objects such as users</b>, <b>computers</b>, <b>attributes</b>, <b>configurations</b>, <b>sites</b>, <b>subnets, group policy objects</b>, and <b>organizational units</b>. In other words, if you lose something you can recover it.</p>
<p>The advantage of this is far beyond convenience. By allowing you to recover without restarting, your service stays online and any damage done to your service is minimized. Whether the system fails due to a security event or a fault you can get the recovery process started immediately. There is also a reporting process that highlights any changes that have taken place since the last backup. This helps you to see if any undesirable changes have taken place.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ManageEngine Free Active Directory Tools</strong> is a pack of 14 utilities to manage AD instances. The group of tools is free to use and includes activity reports that can be exported in CSV files to be examined by third-party tools.</p>
      <p>All of these utilities have the focus of making it easier to manage Active Directory. For example, there is a <b>Free Password Expiry Notifier</b> <b>utility </b>that <b>reminds users to update their passwords via email or SMS</b>. Similarly, the Duplicates Identifier allows you to see all duplicated objects in one click. The result is an <b>Active Directory </b>administrative experience that is more versatile than <b>Active Directory</b> alone.</p>
      <p>Another interesting utility is the <strong>Terminal Session Manager</strong>. <strong>With the Terminal Session Manager the user can utilize a PowerShell cmdlet to find and manage a range of terminal sessions from a centralized location</strong>. This is particularly useful because it allows you to manage and disconnect multiple users from one location.</p>

</a></p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Any system administrator that relies on Active Directory for the corporate access rights management service would benefit from having these fee tools to hand. The package includes tools that would be of more interest to network managers, such as the DMZ Port Analyzer.</p>
<p>The <strong>ManageEngine Free Active Directory Tools </strong>bundle is well worth considering if you’re looking to add a range of new Active Directory functions to your tricks bag. One of the best things about this is that you won’t have to pay for the privilege of these utilities either because <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/products/free-windows-active-directory-tools/free-active-directory-tools-index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything is free to download</a>.</p>

      <p>It’s score may seem low for such a well-known company, but this is a reflection of its decidedly low employee job satisfaction scores. Low job satisfaction among employees may impact the quality of service you get, which could result in a poor customer experience.</p>

This reflects its high scores across every key signal that indicates whether a company will offer good support for customers and adequate ongoing support and updates for its product.</p>
      <p>This company’s only weakness is its employee job satisfaction rating, which is not&nbsp;<em>bad</em>, just&nbsp;<em>average</em>. All told, you’ll likely find Netwrix can support your needs as you work with their product. That is not, however, a guarantee. If you decide to shortlist this one, we recommend you ask the company to lay out more fully how these signals impact its support abilities.</p>

<p>You can use <b>Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner</b> to ascertain why the user has been locked out with relative ease. Whether it’s on account of a disconnected desktop or a task obscuring the service you will be able to tell. This allows you to tell if you need to take further action or if it’s a temporary blip.</p>
<p>Once an administrator has seen that an account has been locked out they can unlock that account through the centralized console or a mobile device. This enables the user to get user accounts unlocked ASAP. As a consequence, normal service can be resumed much quicker than it would be trying to go it alone with <strong>Active Directory</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The account lockout tool is a big timesaver for IT support teams. Any business of any size would benefit from this tool because it is completely free to use.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bulk Password Control</strong> is a free tool that enables an administrator to perform bulk actions on AD user account passwords, such as bulk password resets. One problem with this service is that it tempts administrators to set passwords for all accounts to the same value, which could be a big security weakness for infrequently used accounts where the user is unlikely to log in and set a new password.</p>
<p>However you aren’t limited to resetting passwords for user accounts either; you can also unlock, enable or disable user accounts as well. This gives you a high degree of control over your active directory users and computers so that if you need to restructure or remove an unsuitable account you can do so with ease.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The bulk password management system is a great tool for any business. However, it needs to be used with caution. The tool is free to use, so even small businesses with tight budgets can get access to it. The password generator is a useful tool to avoid populating all accounts with easily-guessable passwords.</p>
<p>The bulk password management ability of this product makes it ideal for larger enterprise environments with lots of different users and accounts. <strong>Bulk Password Control</strong> can be <a href="http://www.wisesoft.co.uk/software/passwordcontrol/bulk_password_control.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloaded for free</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Auvik</strong> will discover all of the devices connected to a network, log them in an inventory, and then map the network. This tool re-checks the network periodically and keeps the network inventory and map constantly up to date.</p>
<p>The Auvik<b> network map</b> has a distinctive style. It isn’t a topographical map, so it couldn’t be laid over a world map or an office layout. Instead, it uses <b>a tree structure</b> that identifies the links between network nodes. This is particularly useful if you want to get a switch port summary of one device because you can get a view showing all the ports on the device that are in use, together with a note on the destination of the cable plugged into each of them.</p>

<p>The network map gives access to details on each device. These are <b>Layer 2</b> and <b>Layer 3</b> systems and you can get details on their addresses, manufacturer, model, and operating capacity. The full Auvik console headlines major issues, which are derived from <b>alerts</b> that identify performance problems or device faults.</p>
<p>The Auvik tool enables you to manage network devices and that includes the standardization and protection of device settings. The service will backup configurations, keep a version library, and enable rollback to any specific point in time. The Auvik system monitor rescans every device every 60 minutes to check on configuration changes. If an unauthorized change is detected, the service restores the stored, standard configuration.</p>
<p>There are two plan levels with the Auvik package: <b>Essentials</b> and <b>Performance</b>. The Essentials service offers network device status reports. The Performance deal gives you bandwidth analysis with live capacity reports that can be viewed in the details of each device.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Auvik is an automated network monitoring and management system. Not only does it map the network, but it will raise an alert if a device is experiencing problems and it will also protect the configurations of network devices. This is a good tool for overworked network managers who just don’t seem to have the time to get anything done.</p>
<p>Auvik doesn’t publish its price list. The exact price depends on which plan is chosen and the size of the network that is to be monitored.

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><b>Faddom</b> is a hybrid IT asset inventory mapping system. It documents your network and all connected devices. That creates an inventory and the Faddom tool generates a map from that list so you’ve got your hardware and software inventories in place. The system is also able to trace through running processes and create an application dependency map.</p>
      <p>The Faddom tool provides hardware and software inventories that can be used for system mapping.</p>

<p>Faddom is an inventory system and it isn’t intended for system monitoring. So, like SolarWinds Topology Mapper, the buyer of this tool would be someone who is happy with an existing network monitor except for the maps that it provides.</p>
<p>Faddom is a downloadable, self-service virtual appliance that can be run on an on-premises or cloud server.

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Domotz</strong> is a SaaS package so you don’t have to host the software on your own site. That also means that the system can monitor any network anywhere across the internet. This service discovers and maps your network and creates a network inventory. These services are constantly updated.</p>
      <p>The Domotz system uses <b>an agent</b> on the monitored network and that program collects data for upload to the Domotz server. Processing is performed on the cloud server and that is also where the console for the system is hosted. The tool performs a network discovery routine, which is based on <b>SNMP</b> and other network protocols, and it repeats constantly, so data is always updated. This information goes into a <b>network asset inventory</b> and this database of devices is the source material for the <b>network map</b>. Whenever the inventory gets updated, the network map gets redrawn.</p>
      <p>This system can monitor <b>physical </b>and <b>virtual</b> networks, plus wireless services. It will track the performance of endpoints, equipment, and IoT devices.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ManageEngine OpManager</strong> is the complete monitoring package for networks. It includes an autodiscovery service that continuously re-scans. With each search, the tool records all encountered devices and lists them in an inventory. From that inventory, OpManager generates topology maps in a variety of formats. OpManager also provides automated monitoring services for network devices.</p>
      <p>The OpManager system runs its first system sweep with <b>Ping</b> and the <b>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</b> to identify every network device and endpoint on the system. It is able to record all information about each device, such as make, model, and operating system.</p>
      <p>The network search also reveals how all of the equipment on the system connect together. This information is then made available to a network topology mapping in the monitoring bundle. The system discovery process is continuous, so it adjusts the <b>network inventory</b> whenever changes are made to the network.</p>

<p>The <b>network topology maps</b> are generated anew whenever the map module is accessed by the user. That means that the topology map that is displayed is always based on the latest version of the network inventory and is never out of date.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>OpManager is suitable for networks of all sizes. Even very small networks can use it because there is a free version that is limited to monitoring three devices. The tool includes alerts on the discovery of a problem, so network managers know that everything is running smoothly unless they are notified otherwise.</p>
<p>OpManager is delivered as on-premises software for <b>Windows Server</b> or <b>Linux</b>. The system is available for a <strong><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/manageengine-network-mapping-topology-network-topology-and-mapping/l/cta/u/2936-0412-8786-7170+152482/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="152482" data-clickid="2936-0412-8786-7170" class="go-link" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">30-day free trial</a></strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Datadog</strong> is a cloud platform that offers many system monitoring and management tools and the <strong>Live Network Mapping</strong> system is part of a module called the Network Performance Monitoring package. This is a traffic management service and it will map your network, showing live traffic flows on each stretch.</p>
      <p>The Live Network Mapping system is able to cover local, remote, and cloud-based systems, even monitoring traffic flows on the internet connections between locations. The service automatically draws up a network map. Once assessed, the network topology view can be altered on demand to show the connections to a specific device, <b>a topology plan</b> of the whole network, or a focused layout of a specific route between two endpoints.</p>
      <p>The plan constantly checks on the nodes available on the network and will <b>automatically redraw</b> the network topology map if any devices are added, moved, or removed. The visualization of the network also shows a live report of the traffic flow throughput on each link.</p>

<p>When compared to Auvik, this service doesn’t quite compete because the Auvik plan gives you network device status checks. You have to add on another module to the Datadog Network Performance Monitoring system, which is called Network Device Monitoring. With these two modules, any network manager can leave network monitoring to the Datadog system.</p>
<p>Datadog’s monitoring systems are <b>charged for by subscription</b> with a rate per month or at a lower rate if paid annually. Both the Network Performance Monitor and the Network Device Monitor include <b>live network mapping.</b></p>

      <p><strong>Microsoft Visio</strong> is a chart-creation tool and it has a library of icons that include network device representations. This tool is a good choice for creating your own network maps.</p>

      <p>As a leading design tool, Visio is a little pricey. However, it includes IT icons and network design templates to speed up your topology mapping tasks.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>There is no network scanning function in Visio and the package isn’t dedicated to creating just network maps. You can use this system to create a wide range of charts. The Visio system would be a great tool for a network consultant who needs to create presentations as well as network maps. A network manager planning a new network without any existing equipment to scan would also benefit from Microsoft Visio.</p>
<p>Visio runs on <b>Windows</b> environments and is also available online. It can be bought individually or added to <b>Microsoft Office 365</b> at an additional cost.</p>

      <p><strong>Intermapper</strong> will scan your network and create a map, which forms the basis for the network monitoring system that is included in the package. The difference between Intermapper and other tools on this list is that the network scan isn’t automatic. You have to demand a refresh.

<p>The settings system of the tool lets you select from mapping templates so you get a layout view with which you are comfortable. These options include a <b>real-world map</b>, which is great for looking at WANs. There is also a <b>map editor</b> in the package, which lets you create a network layout from scratch or read in the data from the inventory and then adjust the generated layout.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>This package is a useful network monitoring package and the mapping service is just part of that service. The provision of both automated map generation and a map editor makes this tool a strong competitor to all of the other mapping systems on this list. This is suitable for networks of all sizes.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p>The <strong>SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper</strong> automatically scans a network and provides a range of network maps, which are redrawn automatically every time the layout of the network changes.</p>
      <p>The mapping discovery procedure can also plot the network infrastructure that composes virtualizations and maps clients to hosts for <b>VMWare</b> and <b>Hyper-V</b> implementations. Maps can be exported into presentation formats for distribution and it is also possible to export them into Visio for further work.</p>
      <p>The map development environment supports different network plans and can compile several perspectives from one scan. The icon library has a suitably diverse set of device representations to enable you to <b>distinguish between types of network equipment</b> visually on the map. You can also adapt existing icon designs to create your own.</p>
      <p>If you don’t want to use an automatically-generated map, you can set the discoverer tool to just create <b>a device inventory</b>, from which you can plot your own topology map. An auto-update feature would not be useful for a network plan for expansion. However, you can store different maps and set your current system topology to update automatically when alterations to the existing network occur.</p>
      <p>Network Topology Mapper offers comprehensive automatic discovery of the network topology with intuitive diagram production. Supports a host of discovery methods. It can run on Windows 10, 8.1, 8, and 7 desktop OS and Windows Server 2003 and later, .Net 3.5 or later</p>
      <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
      <p>There are many tools on this list that perform network mapping and then implement automated system monitoring. So, there probably aren’t many businesses that would prefer to have a tool that only provides maps. This tool would be a good service for very large businesses that don’t feel that the mapping included in automated monitoring services is good enough.</p>
      <p>The network mapper is compliant with PCI and FIPS-2 standards. This software runs on <b>Windows</b> environments and you can access it on a <strong><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/network-topology-mapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">14-day free trial</a></strong>.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Network Notepad</strong> presents a number of usage options. Essentially, it is a graphics editor for the manual creation of a network map. This is a free tool but you can upgrade to a paid version to get autodiscovery and automated mapping. The package also provides a basic network device availability tester that is based on Ping.</p>
      <p>The basic Network Notepad includes a rudimentary discovery system based on <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/cisco-discovery-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1"><b>Cisco Discovery Protocol</b></a>. However, you will probably use this tool more as a network map designer. The editing screen gives you all of the icons that you need to clearly depict your network and the map is built using drag-and-drop. If you use CDP to locate all of your devices, the attributes discovered by that process can be pulled into the descriptions of the network nodes in your map.</p>
      <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
      <p>Network Notepad is a combination tool. Use it to design a new network, discover an existing network and get a map of it that you can adjust, or get it to discover, map, and monitor a network. This system is appropriate for planning or discovering a small network.</p>
      <p>You can run Network Notepad on Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, XP, and 2000. The <a href="http://www.networknotepad.com/download.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">Freeware Edition </a>is easy to download and you can get a 30-day free trial of the <a href="http://www.networknotepad.com/Pro1.3/EN/Download.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">Professional Edition</a> and the <a href="http://www.networknotepad.com/Ent1.0/EN/Download.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">Enterprise Edition</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>LANTopoLog</strong> is a network mapper that is completely free to use. The system includes a discovery service that will identify all of your devices and then create a network map for you.

      <p>The tool includes <b>a network discovery facility, which is based on SNMP</b>. The resulting map, which is drawn automatically, shows each of the devices in your network and the devices that it connects to.

<p><b>This is a rudimentary network monitoring system</b>. Its use as a network mapping tool lies in the list of discovered devices, which you could use as an inventory. This provides you with the current connections between your devices, which you could use as a guide when replanning your network in a graphics tool, such as Visio. This software runs on <b>Windows</b> environments.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>LANTopoLog is a useful tool for anyone who doesn’t want to pay for a network mapping system. The hierarchical layout of the map can be good for when you are planning or reorganizing the connections to each of your switches. That is, you could use a more sophisticated map from another tool to work out where your network devices are and then use this map to examine the utilization of switch ports.</p>
