          <p>Auvik is designed for <b>remote system monitoring</b> – even your home network is remote to the processes on the Auvik servers. Network monitoring works on a system of thresholds. The service tracks a list of metrics on network activity and a threshold for resource usage or system performance is added to each of these conditions. If that <b>threshold level</b> is passed, the Auvik service will generate <b>an alert</b>. This means that your team of technicians doesn’t need to pay attention to the network unless a problem arises.</p>
          <p>The Auvik service can be expanded through the use of third-party tools for which the network monitor has <b>integrations</b>. There are two plan levels for Auvik – Essential and Performance. The Performance plan is the higher plan and it offers <b>traffic analysis</b> functions and <b>Syslog management</b> on top of the network monitoring services that are available in the Essentials plan.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>I feel that multi-site businesses would benefit most from the Auvik service. This network monitoring package enables you to centralize system management in one location.</p>

            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p><b>Paessler PRTG</b> is a very flexible service. You can choose which sensors to turn on and create your own tailored monitoring system for networks, servers, and applications.</p>
            <p>I was impressed with the great visualization, the tool has a <b>customizable dashboard </b>that allowed me to produce <b>real-time network maps</b> of our infrastructure. You can create maps with the drag-and-drop editor and use <b>over 300 map objects </b>to build the map. You can even create your own map objects with custom HTML.</p>
            <p>The<b> threshold-based alerts system </b>keeps you updated if the status of a sensor changes, a value changes or a threshold is breached. <b>Notifications</b> are available in a variety of formats including <b>email, push notification, SMS, Slack message, Syslog message, SNMP trap, HTTP action, execute program,</b> and more.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>The comprehensive nature of PRTG provides extensive monitoring for all categories of IT systems, which makes this a good choice for large organizations. However, the free option, which is limited to 100 sensors, is very appealing to small businesses.</p>

            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p>This cloud-based system can be accessed through any standard Web browser and it can monitor multiple sites simultaneously. Once we were granted access to a site, the autodiscovery feature of <b>Domotz</b> compiled and maintained an inventory and network map.</p>
            <p>The Domotz package has a large number of features. The tool is centered on network monitoring via <b>SNMP</b> and other network protocols. This includes the possibility to easily configure SNMP sensors and alerts. You can also specify your own alert conditions.</p>
            <p>SNMP reports enable the system to compile an <b>asset inventory</b> and draw up a <b>network map</b>. These services are updated with every SNMP agent response cycle. The information attached to each node in the map and the inventory list details the make and model of each divide and its capacity.</p>
            <p>The package also includes a switch port mapper, and management tools within the package allow the remote access and configuration management of network devices. <b>IoT services</b> can also be accessed and controlled remotely. The system is able to cross network platforms to access wireless networks and devices, through hundreds of integrations and the possibility of implementing customized monitoring drivers.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>Domotz offers a multi-tenanted version that is a good fit for use by managed service providers. In-house operations teams could also use this system for multi-site monitoring.</p>
            <p>There are two pricing plans for Domotz.The <strong>Device Plan</strong> costs up to $1.50 per month per device,and their <strong>Location Plan</strong> is priced at $35 or less per month, per location.

              <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
              <p><b>Checkmk Raw</b> is a fantastic system monitoring package for free. This system covers wireless networks as well as LANs and it will track traffic patterns along with network device statuses.</p>
              <p>On testing, this network monitoring system started its service by searching the network and identifying all connected devices. The package compiled <b>a device inventory</b> from the results of this search and the resultant list of equipment formed the basis of the network monitoring dashboard’s status reports. The package also created <b>a live network map</b>.</p>
              <p>The base package of Checkmk is completely <b>free to use</b>. There is also a paid version of the system, called <b>Checkmk Enterprise</b>, which has an edition that caters to managed service providers.</p>
              <p>As a free tool, the basic service is very attractive to small businesses and companies on a tight budget. The monitor queries switches, routers, and firewalls through the <b>SNMP</b> system. All of your network devices will already have SNMP agents installed on them but that function might need to be enabled. The Checkmk software polls agents for status reports. The responses get compiled into <b>live reports</b> on network readiness and capacity performance.</p>
              <p>The dashboard allows network managers to get <b>an overview</b> of all activity and then has a number of options to drill down through to reports on individual devices both live and over time. The Checkmk package also offers <b>bandwidth monitoring</b>, which gives you indicators on where device and cable capacity is not enough to cope with demand.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>The Checkmk Raw system is an ideal solution for small businesses and startups that are operating tight cost controls. The device-based option for the paid Checkmk Enterprise keeps servers free for application hosting.</p>
              <p>The paid version of Checkmk is priced on a sliding scale based on the number of hosts that are on the monitored network. Access the free version, which is called Checkmk Raw to assess the package. Both Checkmk Raw and Checkmk Enterprise run on Linux. The Enterprise edition can also be bought on a physical appliance.

            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p><b>NinjaOne RMM</b> optimizes the productivity of your IT support technicians. Alerts in the package mean that no one needs to sit and watch the activity on each remote site because the technical team will be notified if a problem arises. The system checks for network device availability and tracks traffic throughput volumes.</p>
            <p>When an MSP has a new client to monitor, a technician needs to install a NinjaOne <b>agent</b> on a computer connected to the remote network. This agent sends out requests for network service status reports and then forwards the received data to the NinjaOne server.</p>
            <p>Those device reports reveal what equipment is on the network. On testing, NinjaOne RMM compiled a <b>hardware inventory</b> from that information. As well as reference information, the tool brought back live device activity data, which it displayed in the dashboard. Those reports contain more data sets than the console can display and we got the opportunity to <b>customize</b> the dashboard to choose the metrics that you believe are important.</p>
            <p>Each of the gathered statistics can have performance thresholds placed on them and when these levels are crossed, the system triggers an alert. The RMM also collects traffic through data using the <b>NetFlow</b>, <b>J-Flow</b>, <b>sFlow</b>, and <b>IPFIX</b> protocols. These statistics can also have alert thresholds placed on them.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>The NinjaOne RMM is designed for use by managed service providers. However, there is nothing to stop IT departments from using the platform for in-house monitoring. We found that the tool can monitor multiple sites simultaneously and it also includes endpoint monitoring and management systems, such as a patch manager.</p>
            <p>G2’s 11-time consecutive acknowledgment placed NinjaOne atop in RMM, Patch Management, and Endpoint Management. You can get a custom quote for NinjaOne based on your needs.

            <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
            <p><b>Progress WhatsUp Gold</b> provides detailed, customizable dashboards that give users the ability to track the health of the entire network at a glance. It allows for granular reporting and alerts, which help teams stay proactive by notifying them of potential problems such as device outages or performance degradation.</p>
            <p>The base package of WhatsUp Gold sets itself up through an autodiscovery process. This documents and maps all devices and then immediately starts continuous monitoring. The service is highly automated and users won’t need to pay attention to the console unless a problem arises. The tool will raise an alert and send out a notification when technicians are needed.</p>
            <p>Once that core unit is operational, buyers can consider the other units that Progres offers. These other modules plug into the core console and add on monitoring for network traffic, servers, applications, and virtual systems.</p>
            <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
            <p>This package is ideal for network administrators and IT professionals in businesses of all sizes, offering comprehensive network monitoring, real-time issue detection, and customizable dashboards. It suits organizations with complex, multi-site infrastructures, providing proactive monitoring, automated alerts, detailed reporting, and third-party integrations for efficient IT management.</p>
            <p>Progress WhatsUp Gold runs on Windows Server and I found it very easy to install and use.

          <p>An intuitive visualization of server loads</p>
          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p>The <b>ManageEngine OpManager</b> system is one of the few detailed network monitoring systems that offers a graphical user interface for Linux. While most Linux network monitors are command-line systems, the high-quality graphs and charts of OpManager make status recognition easy.</p>
          <p><b>SNMP monitoring</b> keeps you updated on the performance of devices within your network. For increased visibility, you can use the<b> network mapping </b>feature to <b>automatically discover and map </b>new devices. You can schedule network discovery to find new devices once they’re added to your network.</p>
          <p>We tested the alerts system which helps you to respond to performance changes quickly. It worked flawlessly. ManageEngine OpManager correlates network events and only presents relevant alerts to the user while minimizing false positives. The program sends alerts by<b> email </b>and<b> SMS</b> to keep you updated on any emerging problems.</p>
          <p>ManageEngine OpManager is an all-in-one network monitor that is recommended for users that want a simple infrastructure monitoring tool.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>This software package installs on Linux, Windows Server, Azure, and AWS. Although it works well on all these platforms, of all the network monitoring systems designed to run on Linux, ManageEngine OpManager is considered to be the best option.</p>
          <p>ManageEngine OpManager is an all-in-one network monitor that is recommended for users that want a simple infrastructure monitoring tool. Paid versions start at $245 (~£195) for 10-1,000 devices up to $11,545 (~£9,000 for 250-10,000 devices.

           <p>This package has a multi-tenant architecture, which means that MSPs can set up subaccounts on the platform. Each subaccount will hold the data of a single client of the MSP. So, the MSP can keep the data for each client completely separate.</p>

           <p>The <b>SuperOps</b> system is a good choice to be on our list because it offers a suitable solution for managed service providers.

              <p>The RMM includes a <b>summary</b> of all devices on the network and each entry in this list provides a link through to a details screen. The service provides automated monitoring because it will raise an alert if the network scanner identifies a problem with a network device. This means that technicians don’t have to watch the monitoring console to wait for problems.</p>
              <p>The RMM is designed to enable one MSP technician to look after the system of multiple businesses. This <b>efficiency</b> is essential because it is the key feature that enables MSPs to undercut in-house IT departments and encourage companies to outsource their IT asset management.</p>
              <p>The network monitoring service doesn’t just track switches, routers, and firewalls; it also lists <b>endpoints</b>, such as servers and workstations. The network monitoring service forms the basis for endpoint management features that include software license management and patching.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>The SuperOps system is ideal for managed service providers. MSPs will be likely to take one of the combined packages that include both RMM and PSA systems. However, SuperOps also offers an RMM-only bundle. This edition is suitable for use by IT departments who need the system support tools in the RMM system but not the MSP management software that the PSA provides.</p>
              <p>SuperOps is available in four editions: <b>RMM only</b>, <b>PSA only</b>, <b>Pro</b> Unified Basic, and <b>Super</b> Unified Advanced.

          <p>A summary view of a device’s characteristics and status</p>
          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p>The <b>Site24x7 Network Monitoring</b> service is bundled in with other monitors for servers, applications, and Web assets. You choose which services to track and set up performance thresholds that trigger alerts.</p>
          <p>The autodiscovery feature of Site24x7 is driven by the <b>Simple Network Management Protocol</b> <b>(SNMP)</b>. This system is built into all network devices. It just needs an SNMP manager to request status information from the agent software that is loaded onto every switch and router by their manufacturers. Site24x7 fulfills that SNMP manager.</p>
          <p>SNMP includes a procedure that allows device agents to send a notification to the manager when it discovers a critical condition on the device that it is monitoring. This message gets converted into a <b>warning</b> or an <b>alert</b> by the Site24x7 dashboard, depending on the severity rating marked on the message from the agent.</p>
          <p>Site24x7 monitors switches, routers, firewall appliances, power supplies, load balancers, wireless networks, cloud services, and WAN connections. It isn’t a bandwidth traffic monitor. The monitor focuses on connected hardware. A wider view of the Site24x7 package shows that the system also monitors other hardware, such as <b>endpoints </b>and <b>servers</b>. It also tracks the performance of applications. <b>A user behavior module</b> in the package is of particular use to businesses that run websites. It includes <b>real user monitoring</b> to analyze typical buyer journeys and also <b>synthetic web transaction monitoring</b>, which simulates access to a website.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>The plans of Site24x7 are particularly strong on Web application monitoring and combine those services with network and connection testing services. Therefore, businesses that run websites would benefit from choosing this option.</p>
          <p>Site24x7 offers a <b>free network monitoring service</b>. However, this is just a straightforward Ping-based uptime monitor for up to 50 URLs or servers. The cloud platform offers a range of system monitoring and management tools and these are packaged in editions. There are five editions in total:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Website Monitoring</li>
          <li>Infrastructure</li>
          <li>APM</li>
          <li>All-in-one</li>
          <li>MSP</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of these packages include the network monitoring service. Each of the Site24x7 plans is available on a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/site24x7-network-monitoring-free-trial/l/cta/u/9172-7284-0381-2012+66031/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="66031" data-clickid="9172-7284-0381-2012" class="go-link"><b>30-day free trial</b></a>.</p>

          <p>Drill down to see each device’s connections and characteristics</p>
          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p><b>Intermapper</b> crowds a lot of information onto one screen, which saved me time looking through network performance information because I didn’t need to switch pages in the interface. The Intermapper implemented autodiscovery and created a rudimentary map to illustrate live performance status reporting.</p>
          <p>The network map operates as a menu to details on each of the devices on the network. Click on an icon to see the activity on that particular node. You will see throughput data as well as <b>status reports</b>.</p>
          <p>I was able to set <b>performance threshold</b> levels on each of the metrics that the monitor tracks, such as CPU capacity or interface throughout. This helped me monitor availability and other SLA-related conditions because the system will raise an alert if one of those thresholds gets tripped.</p>
          <p>You can set up the preferences in the system so that Intermapper will send you an <b>email</b> or a <b>text message</b> if an alert occurs. That means that I didn’t have to sit and watch the network monitoring screen all of the time.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>

            <p>Although NetCrunch is able to monitor servers and cloud services, its main feature is its network monitoring system. The tool’s alerting mechanism comes with pre-written rules. A rule is a chain of actions that starts with data collection – this is the monitoring part of the process. Each measurement is compared to a range of acceptable values. If the statistic is outside the range, NetCrunch generates an alert.</p>
            <p>The alerts of the NetCrunch system appear in the console and you can set up the service to forward those warnings as notifications to specific people in your team. Those messages can be sent by email, Slack, SMS, Teams, or other collaboration systems. The tool can also feed tickets into your project management system, such as Jira or Service Desk routing package, such as Trello, Zendesk, or Asana.</p>
            <p>Alerts can also be set up to trigger actions, which creates a mechanism for automatic problem remediation. This possibility is very powerful but takes some planning and you probably won’t get into that capability until you have become an expert user of the NetCrunch system. Alerts can be customized and triggered by a series of conditions.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>This package is suitable for any type of size of business. It is able to monitor virtual systems, such as VMware or Hyper-V and it will also watch the response times of your cloud services and the connections to them. The ease of use of this package makes it particularly appealing for small businesses and startups that might not have a big technical support team on the payroll.</p>
            <p>There are three editions of the NetCrunch package, which makes the system suitable for all sizes of businesses. There are Essentials, which provides SNMP-based device monitoring, Professional, which adds on server and VM monitoring, and Enterprise, which also gives you traffic monitoring and cloud service tracking.

          <p>It is easy to identify the stressed connections that are adding load to the network.</p>
          <p>The Network Performance Monitor is able to blend together the network monitoring effort for many sites and also <b>include cloud resources</b>. As a SaaS package, the service includes the processor to run the monitoring software and storage space for gathered statistics. As well as displaying <b>live statuses</b>, this network monitoring service offers packet capture and <b>analysis utilities</b>.</p>
          <p>By combining both the Network Performance Monitor and the Network Device Monitor, you get complete oversight of your networks. The system implements an <b>autodiscovery</b> function on enrollment that identifies all of the devices connected to your network. The service creates an <b>IT asset inventory</b> and then generates a <b>network topology map</b> from that. The autodiscovery process repeats continuously, so any changes you make to your infrastructure are automatically reflected in the network inventory and the topology map.</p>
          <p>The Network Device Monitor uses the <b>Simple Network Management Protocol</b> (SNMP) to query switches and routers for status reports. These reports are interpreted, providing live device health data on the screen. This system also gathers information about each device, such as make, model, age, and processor capacity.</p>
          <p>Each network device has <b>an SNMP agent </b>preloaded onto it by its manufacturer and if that program spots a problem with the device it sends out a notification. The Datadog Network Device Monitoring service picks up those messages and displays them in the system console as <b>alerts</b>.</p>
          <p>The alerting mechanism in Datadog Network Device Monitoring can be extended to generate an alert if any of the metrics that the system gathers passes a specified <b>threshold</b>. You can set up your own thresholds to get alerts on any condition that you choose. The alerting system is also available in the Network Performance Monitor so traffic limits will be highlighted when bottlenecks start to form.</p>
          <p>You can set up an alert forwarding rule so that you can receive <b>notifications</b> by email, SMS, PagerDuty message or Slack message. This means that you can leave the two network monitoring systems to automatically monitor the network because you know that you will be notified if human attention is needed.</p>
          <p>The traffic monitoring services in the Network Performance Monitoring module don’t just count packets circulating around the network. It is also able to identify data traffic within a <b>virtualization</b> system and it can perform activity monitoring for <b>containers</b>. The tool extends to cloud services, where it is able to show you the traffic in and out of each of your cloud-based accounts.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>Centralized data centers would benefit most from the Datadog Network Monitoring service. The package can be set up remotely to monitor any network without any site visit.</p>
          <p><b>Datadog Network Performance Monitoring</b> and <b>Datadog Network Device Monitoring</b> are just two modules on the Datadog platform.

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) recorded activity metrics per user account and IP source.</p>
            <p>Response mechanisms in Reveal(x) can be set up to run automatically. These use orchestration to shut down threats by coordinating with third-party systems. The ExtraHop platform is also available in an edition to protect cloud systems.</p>
            <h4>Who is it recommended for?</h4>
            <p>ExtraHop Reveal(x) is probably a little too complex for the needs of small businesses. However, mid-sized and large companies will benefit from using this network security monitoring system.</p>
            <p>ExtraHop Reveal(x) is offered as a SaaS platform. It is also possible to get the system as a network appliance. You can examine ExtraHop by accessing <a href="https://www.extrahop.com/demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a>.</p>

           <p><b>AKIPS</b> combines network device monitoring and network traffic analysis. These are two functions that most monitoring systems providers split into two separate units.

              <p>The device dashboard uses both <b>SNMP</b> and <b>Ping</b> to check on each device. This enables the system to check for availability because if a device goes offline, it will cease to exist in the SNMP system. If the device has a problem but is still running, the AKIPS console will receive an SNMP Trap message. This is interpreted into an <b>alert</b>. The package can forward alerts as <b>notifications</b> by Teams, Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, or Opsgenie.</p>
              <p>The AKIPS system also raises an alert if a previously detected device disappears. It is possible to define <b>performance thresholds</b> on factors such as traffic throughput. So, for example, if traffic levels on a link suddenly drop, or reach the full capacity of the switch interface to which it connects, the system will generate an alert. These conditions are detailed in the <b>Events Dashboard</b> of the AKIPS console.</p>
              <p>AKIPS provides information about the network that can help with capacity. This category of data includes information on unused interfaces or traffic patterns per link over time. The system can forward its data as logs to <b>SIEM</b> systems for activity analysis.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>AKIPS doesn’t publish its price list, which makes a decision on its suitability for small businesses difficult to make. The package doesn’t include system to check on internet links to cloud platforms or between sites, so this is a LAN management package. The service is ideal for monitoring a single network.</p>
              <p>The AKIPS system installs in <b>a VM</b>, which means that it can run on any operating system. Within the hypervisor, the network monitoring software actually runs on <b>FreeBSD Unix</b>. However, that operating system is included in the installation package.

              <p>The network maps show broken connections that need attention in red.</p>
              <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
              <p>The <b>SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor</b> is an automated tracking system that identifies all devices connected to the network, maps them, and watches out for performance issues. This system will alert you of gathering problems and send a notification. Alongside solid vulnerability scanning and advanced options to create and monitor policies, this is by far the top choice for network monitoring systems.</p>
              <p>Any devices, applications, or services that have been discovered can also be viewed on a <b>network topology map</b> where you can see how your infrastructure links together. The <b>NetPath</b> feature allows you to<b> trace packet transfers hop-by-hop</b>, which can help to diagnose the origin of performance network issues more effectively.</p>
              <p>The custom alerts system enables you to<b> set trigger conditions for alerts</b>. Once the trigger conditions are met the software will send you a notification by <b>email</b> or <b>SMS</b> to let you know that an event has taken place. The user can view a comprehensive list of alerts according to severity by going to the <b>All Active Alerts</b> page.</p>
              <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
              <p>I was impressed how this tool automates network monitoring – it even sets itself up, so it is suitable for all sizes of enterprises because it doesn’t require specialized network management knowledge to operate. Alerts mean that you can assume everything is running OK unless you get a notification, so you can spend your time on other issues and let the NPM take care of the network. Our testing surfaced the following pros and cons for NPM.</p>

            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p><b>Nagios Core</b> is one of the most reliable and respected open-source IT asset monitoring packages that will monitor networks, applications, and servers. This version of Nagios is free to use but you should also consider the paid <b>Nagios XI</b> edition.</p>
            <p>We were able to track performance events through the alerts system, which sent out notifications by <b>email</b> and <b>SMS</b>. You can view the <b>Alert History </b>section to see what alerts were created and when. The list of alerts is also color-coded making it easier to prioritize critical alerts.</p>
            <p>We were able to use APIs to integrate other network services. If you require more functions then you can also check the <b>thousands of community plugins available</b> on the <b>Nagios Exchange </b>to help you add additional functions. For example, there is a check SNMP CPU load plugin that allows you to monitor the SNMP load or <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/cpu-monitoring-software-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPU usage of your network device</a>.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>Nagios Core doesn’t have a proper user interface but it has a very flexible and powerful discovery and data-gathering engine. Therefore, it is a good option if you want to create your own monitoring application with a free data representation tool, such as Kibana or Prometheus, and feed in data from this tool.</p>
            <p><b>Nagios Core </b>is an excellent free network monitoring software however the setup can be slightly more hands-on than other products on this list. <a href="https://www.nagios.org/projects/nagios-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download Nagios Core for free</a>, or depending on your needs, see how it compares with <a href="https://www.nagios.org/downloads/nagios-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Nagios XI</b></a>.

            <h4>Why do we recommend it?</h4>
            <p><b>Catchpoint Network Experience</b> is intended for use as part of a suite of tools that ensures the successful delivery of Web pages and other Web applications. Therefore, this tool is excellent for checking on the successful delivery of Web systems. It forms part of a monitoring chain that can quickly identify the root cause of performance issues.</p>
            <p>The other modules in the Catchpoint platform are an application monitor and real user and synthetic monitoring tools for Web applications. The network service checks on the performance of connections to the different servers that contribute to the successful delivery of a Web page and its contents. These other servers include content delivery networks (CDNs), DNS servers, and serverless hosts of the microservices that get triggered by user interactions within a Web page.</p>
            <p>The Network Experience system also analyzes the activities of virtual networks, such as Secured Access Service Edge (SASE) and SD-WANs. It will identify performance issues with remote access and site-to-site VPNs and then trace through a LAN to the Web servers that hold the company’s websites.</p>
            <h4>Who is it recommended for?</h4>
            <p>The full Catchpoint platform is specifically designed to track the performance of websites, so it isn’t a good choice for businesses that need a LAN monitoring service. Businesses that host their own sites will be the most suitable customers for the Catchpoint system. However, those companies that use hosting services and CDNs to optimize delivery can also benefit from the Catchpoint service.</p>
            <p>Although Catchpoint is a SaaS package, it does have an onsite element, which is called the Enterprise Node. This installs on one of your servers and manages the monitoring of your Web host and the network links between it and the outside world. This agent runs on <b>RHEL</b> and <b>CentOS Linux</b>. It can also be run as a virtual appliance over <b>Hyper-V</b> or <b>VMware</b>. Catchpoint is available for a <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14-day free trial</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Icinga</b> was developed as an improvement to Nagios and that background gives this system a big advantage over many of the other tools on this list. It is completely free to use, just like <b>Nagios Core</b> but, like <b>Nagios XI</b>, it has a useful graphical user interface that is delivered with pre-written screens but is also customizable. Icinga is still compatible with Nagios plug-ins, so users of this system can enhance the monitoring tool from Nagios Exchange as well as with plug-ins from the much smaller Icinga Exchange.</p>
            <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
            <p>We love that Icinga is a free, open-source monitoring package for networks, applications, and servers. It was developed by a team of Nagios creators who were unhappy with the direction of that system’s evolution.</p>
            <p>You can log in to the GUI and use the dashboard to view an overview of performance management. The dashboard displays whether there are any problems with performance or availability and color-codes them according to severity. <b>Critical</b> or <b>Down</b> network devices are marked in red.</p>
            <p>Extensions or <b>Icinga Modules</b>, allow you to add more functions to the program. For example, the <b>Icinga Module for vSphere</b> allows you to monitor virtual machines and host systems. There is a range of community-created plugins you can download for free from the<b> Icinga Exchange</b>.</p>
            <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
            <p>As it is open source, Icinga can be rewritten and its compatibility with Nagios means that it can be extended by the free plug-in library of that rival system. These features make it great for network engineers with programming skills who want to create a bespoke network monitoring tool.</p>
            <p>Overall, Icinga is a scalable solution that gives you control over how you manage your environment. Icinga is available for Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Raspbian, and Windows. You can <a href="https://icinga.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the free trial version</a>.</p>

          <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
          <p><b>Zabbix</b> is a free tool that can be expanded by templates. This service can monitor networks, servers, and applications and it uses SNMP to discover and monitor network devices.</p>
          <p>Network monitoring templates make it easy to configure the program for monitoring. For example, there are <b>preconfigured</b> <b>templates</b> for vendors such as<b><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/cisco-network-monitoring-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Cisco</a>, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell, Intel, Netgear,</b> and more. If you require more variety then you can access even more community templates form the Zabbix community site.</p>
          <p>To ensure that you can respond to alerts in time, <b>Zabbix</b> has a <b>notification system</b>. Alerts are sent by <b>email, SMS, messenger, jabber, </b>or<b> custom scripts</b> to update you on evolving network security events. The notification content can be customized according to the recipient to make sure that the point of contact has everything they need to reopen intelligently.</p>
          <h4><b>Who is it recommended for?</b></h4>
          <p>Zabbix is a Linux-based on-premises package and its competitive edge against many of the tools on this list is that it is free to use. The screens for this system contain great data visualization features and they can be customized, which makes this one of the easiest tools to tailor without the need for technical abilities.</p>
          <p>Zabbix is one of the top Linux network monitoring tools on the market. Autodiscovery and templates make the program straightforward to deploy. The software for the package is installed on <b>Linux</b>, <b>macOS</b>, and <b>Unix</b>. Although the main server for Zabbix isn’t available for <b>Windows</b>, there is an agent program that enables it to monitor Windows endpoints over a network. You can <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the software for free</a>.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>Its API-based email protection integrates directly with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, without having to reroute traffic or invest in a secure email gateway. Moreover, it has a wide coverage of threats to address multiple threats. Its all-in-one console offers centralized management and visibility to admins.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: AI-Powered Phishing Simulation</b></h4>
      <p>A key feature of Guardz is its AI-powered phishing simulation that helps identify the weakest links in your organization, and those that are most likely to fall during a phishing attack. Using this information, you can strengthen these weak links to avoid an attack.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 8.6</b></span></h4>
      <p>Guardz provides a decent level of customer support. Its dedicated support team and extensive self-supporting documentation can answer most concerns and questions. The financial stability can be better, and it remains to be seen if the company will increase its headcount in the future.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><b>Guardz</b> is a cloud platform of security scanning systems that aims to protect company resources and data from hacker access. One of the key routes into a business’s systems is through email tricks, such as phishing to gain account credentials or impersonation to manipulate employees into action. This package also filters out spam emails.</p>
      <p>This package specifically monitors the components of <b>Microsoft 365 </b>and&nbsp; <b>Google Workspace</b>. It protects data held in One Drive by scanning attacks launched against email accounts in Outlook/Exchange Server and attacks on data in Google Drive through trick emails sent to Gmail accounts.</p>
      <p>When this system spots spam emails or attacks, such as phishing or business email compromise (BEC) it moves those suspicious communications to a quarantine area away from the mailboxes of users. The package alerts technicians by recording the detection in the Guardz dashboard. The emails can be viewed and assessed in case they have been flagged as malicious in error.</p>
      <p>The Guardz system is also able to scan endpoints for attacks and alert on discoveries such as malware or intrusion. This package is intended for use by managed service providers to protect the systems of their clients.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>This system is available to individuals as well as to teams because the minimum team size for the account is one. However, Guardz insists that the package needs to be administered by a managed service provider rather than by an in-house IT support team.</p>
<p>Guardz is available for use by managed service providers to protect the data of their clients and clean the email systems of those protected companies. You can examine the Guardz platform with a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/guardz-anti-spam-software/l/cta/u/3348-7141-8497-0004+212897/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="212897" data-clickid="3348-7141-8497-0004" class="go-link"><b>14-day free trial</b></a>.</p>

                <h3>EDITOR'S CHOICE</h3>
                                    <p><b>Guardz</b> is our top pick for anti-spam software because this package also identifies phishing and BEC threats, blocking all three hacker activities. The tool will identify malware and ransomware in attachments to emails and block them as well. When this package spots a malicious email, it raises an alert in the system dashboard and moves the offending email into quarantine. A technician can review emails logged into the quarantine system to check whether some genuine emails got miscategorized. In these instances, it is possible to restore the intercepted email back to the recipient’s mailbox. This tool specializes in protecting Gmail and Google Drive in Google Workspace and Outlook, Exchange Server, and OneDrive in the Microsoft 365 suite. </p>

<p><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></p>
<p>MailWasher allows users to preview emails on the server before they are downloaded. This unique option gives greater control and visibility to users and, at the same time, protects the devices from malware. It is also compatible with many email clients.</p>
<p><b>Feature-in-Focus: Real-Time Blacklist Integration</b></p>
<p>MailWasher integrates with real-time blacklists to identify messages that come from known spam sources. This saves time and resources, and is also highly effective in detecting and blocking spam messages. This blacklist can also be customized to meet your unique needs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 3.9</b></span></p>
<p>Many questions linger about the future of this company from a customer service standpoint. Currently, it doesn’t have a dedicated team, and its overall employee headcount is also low, raising questions about how it can offer support in the future. Though it has self-service documentation, it may not be enough. The funding/revenue is also on the lower side.</p>
<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Mailwasher</strong> is a proxy service that intercepts emails and blocks spam and malware while passing through all other emails. This service integrates with a lot more email services that the other options on this list and that includes Webmail systems.</p>
<p>To stop viruses from entering your inbox, the program allows you to <strong>preview and delete emails before they are downloaded </strong>to your computer. By blocking emails like this you can view information within the email without opening it and leaving your computer at risk of transmitting a virus.</p>
<p>Filtering is another way that <strong>Mailwasher </strong>monitors incoming emails for suspicious signs. The <strong>filter can spot spam content and offensive words </strong>so that the sender can be automatically blacklisted from future correspondence. To stop false alerts you can add colleagues and clients to your ‘<em>friends’</em> list.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Mailwasher is a good choice for any business. Small businesses can access Mailwasher Free, which only protects one email account but it is possible to sign up for several accounts.</p>
<p>There are two versions of <strong>Mailwasher </strong>available to download: <strong>Mailwasher Free </strong>and <strong>Mailwasher Pro</strong>. <strong>Mailwasher Free </strong>is available <strong><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/mailwasher-anti-spam-software/l/cta/u/6740-6178-8253-1875+212897/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="212897" data-clickid="6740-6178-8253-1875" class="go-link">free of charge</a></strong> and supports one email address.&nbsp;<b>MailWasher Pro </b>starts from $49.95 (£37.71) and supports multiple email addresses with support seven days a week.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>ESET Protect Mail Plus is a multi-layered email protection solution. It combines proprietary anti-spam, anti-phishing, and anti-malware technologies to provide advanced defense against known and zero-day threats. Its 64-bit architecture with clustering support ensures performance and scalability for organizations of all sizes.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: Anti-Spam Engine</b></h4>
      <p>The anti-spam engine of ESET uses a combination of techniques like SMTP protection, SPF, DKIM validation, and backscatter protection to filter spam emails, making it highly effective. These filters can also identify ransomware, malware, and phishing attacks to protect your organization. Furthermore, you can also set up custom rules based on your organization’s needs.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 9.6</b></span></h4>
      <p>A solid company with good financials, well-developed self-supporting documentation, and a dedicated team providing customer service. Its employee job satisfaction index is also good. Due to these factors, we can expect continued high-quality support from ESET.</p>
      <h4>Why do we recommend it?</h4>
      <p>The anti-spam feature of <b>ESET Protect Mail Plus</b> will improve with service and it will also adapt to each user’s preferences. It could be that a particular unsolicited email is from a site that the user visits and its contents are of interest to the recipient. In which case, repeated access by that user to emails from that source will de-list that source as a spam sender.</p>
      <p>The <b>anti-spam</b> and <b>anti-phishing</b> processes are a little more complicated. Spam filtering relies on whether emails from particular sources and with particular subject lines have previously been listed as unwanted. This blacklisting is based both on global experience and on the reaction of the user, such as deleting an email without reading it.</p>
      <p>The anti-phishing process is similar to the anti-spam service. It uses machine learning and external source and text databases to spot undesirable emails.</p>
      <h4>Who is it recommended for?</h4>
      <p>This system only operates on the Microsoft Exchange Server and IBM Domino email systems, so if you don’t use either of those, you will need to look elsewhere for a spam filter. The smallest package you can buy covers five hosts, so it isn’t suitable for very small businesses.</p>
      <p>ESET Protect Mail Plus is a subscription package with an annual rate and you can get a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/eset-anti-spam-software/l/cta/u/5517-2604-0759-4021+212897/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-postid="212897" data-clickid="5517-2604-0759-4021" class="go-link"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a>.

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>This is a comprehensive email security platform that comes with advanced anti-spam filters and phishing email detectors. It is cloud-based, and hence ideal for both MSPs and organizations catering to a geographically-diverse workforce. It has been featured in the Virus Bulletin Q4 2024 for achieving a malware false positive rate of 0.00%.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: Anti-Spam Filters</b></h4>
      <p>A highlight of TitanHQ is its advanced spam filters that take a multi-layered approach to spam detection. It uses Bayesian auto-learning, heuristics, and real-time blacklists. Together, these strategies block spam from known IP addresses and follow specific patterns. Also, its machine-learning strategies help the tool to learn and adapt to evolving spam patterns for a high success rate.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 7.8</b></span></h4>
      <p>TitanHQ is a small but growing company. Its self-supporting documentation is comprehensive, and the funding has been adequate to support its operations. Though the employee’s job satisfaction score is reasonable, the concern is its low employee count. This can affect the company’s customer support if it expands to newer markets in the future.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Email Security</strong> implements AI-based detection that scans through the contents of each email and looks for anomalies, such as address spoofing. The tool can build up its own blacklist for a specific client company but the company doesn’t deploy a global blacklist like N-able Mail Assure.</p>
      <p><strong>IP address whitelisting</strong> and <strong>blacklisting </strong>controls whether mail reaches your inbox or gets blocked from future communication. For wider security, you can apply different degrees of <strong>Spam Confidence Levels </strong>to <strong>users</strong>, <strong>user groups</strong>, and <strong>domains</strong>. By segmenting your email environment in this fashion you can manage potential entry points much more effectively.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Email Security is a cloud-based system, so you don’t need to have technical skills to install it. The system plugs into Microsoft 365, so it will monitor all of the Outlook mailboxes for your users. However, the TitanHQ Email Security system isn’t available for any other email system. The minimum number of email accounts this service will cover is 25, so it isn’t suitable for very small businesses.</p>
<p>Prices are levied as a subscription with a rate per user per month. There is a <b>minimum order</b> of 25 user licenses. The price per user per month lowers if you choose a longer payment cycle. The options range from a monthly payment to a 3-year payment plan. The <b>lowest price</b> comes with the 3-year plan, which works out at $1.49 (£1.12) per user per month. However, you have to pay for the whole payment period in advance, so that 3-year option for 25 users works out at an upfront payment of $1,336,50 (£1008.95).

      <p>A highlight of this tool is its Bayesian filters that continuously learn and adapt to emerging spam patterns to provide 100% protection over time.

You can also add sophisticated rules to customize these filters.</p>

      <p><strong>SpamSieve</strong> is specifically designed to operate on the native email system for Macs and other email clients that run on macOS. This tool is very easy to install because it is offered as a plug-in. The system builds up a whitelist and a blacklist over time to fine-tune blocking for your regular activity.</p>
      <p>This spam filtering solution includes whitelisting and blacklisting and it uses <b>machine learning</b> to improve spam identification in your Inbox over time. You can set up your own block list and also customize other features of the interface, such as its color and layout. SpamSieve also allows you to create your own mailbox management <b>scripts</b> that perform different actions depending on factors such as the sender or subject line.</p>
      <p>SpamSieve works as <b>a plug-in</b> so you can access its functions from within your email client instead of needing to go to a different application. It will work with a long list of email systems on Macs, including Apple Mail (Mail.app), Airmail, Entourage, MailMate, Mailsmith, Postbox 5, PowerMail, and Outlook.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>A comprehensive email protection tool that leverages the latest technologies to detect and block spam and neutralize phishing attempts. Its cloud-based architecture makes it easy to deploy and scale for businesses of all sizes. Its detailed reporting and customizable policies are other key additions.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: AI-powered Threat Detection</b></h4>
      <p>The standout feature of Trustifi Inbound Shield is its AI-powered threat detection, which analyzes incoming messages in real-time and, based on its patterns, blocks the spam. The advantage of this feature is that it continuously learns and adapts to match the evolving changes in spam messages.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Comparitech SupportScore – 6.2</b></span></h4>
      <p>Trustifi is a mixed bag when it comes to customer support. Its self-service documentation is excellent and can answer most questions. While the job satisfaction index is high, the number of employees is really low. Though this approach seems to be working well for the company so far, there are questions about how it can look in the future. Its funding is also a little suspect, and this is one area to consider.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Trustifi</strong> is a very effective spam filter. However, there are many tools on this list that match that description. The advantage that this tool has over its rivals is that it is very easy to implement. The service is delivered as a plug-in for all of the major email systems, including those that are cloud-based, such as Microsoft Exchange and Gmail.</p>
      <p>The Trustifi system is able to spot spam, phishing emails, and bulk emails that are termed “graymail.” The system uses a combination of <b>AI-based threat detection</b> and email address and IP address blacklists. It looks at source email addresses and correlates them to known identifies of employees to block impersonation attempts. It can also detect <b>malicious links</b> to impersonating or infected websites.</p>

      <p>Legitimate mail is forwarded straight to your email server. <strong>MX Guarddog automatically syncs email addresses from Windows AD</strong>, <strong>LDAP</strong>, and <strong>cPanel </strong>systems for convenience. In the event that your server goes down, your mail will be stored and automatically delivered to you the next time you’re online.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>SPAMfighter is a community-driven spam filtering tool that integrates with all Windows-based email clients. It offers both a free and a pro version geared for individuals and businesses, respectively. The pro version comes with advanced features like automatic whitelist management and language filtering.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: Community-Driven Approach</b></h4>
      <p>The highlight of this tool is its community-driven approach, which means emails with specific patterns are categorized as spam based on how multiple users report them. This feature helps SPAMfighter to identify new spam threats more effectively.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p>The <strong>SPAMfighter</strong> system works on a crowdsourced intelligence model. When a user receives an email and marks it as spam, the source email address and IP address get flagged. If enough users flag the same source, it gets added to the global blacklist.</p>
      <p>The user interface is simple to navigate and you can <b>view live statistics on blocked messages</b>.

<p>Home users will definitely want to try the free SPAMfighter. For businesses, the reliance on enough people reporting a spam email campaign might seem a little weak. However, the system has more than 8 million users, so it should be able to catch most spam campaigns.</p>
<p>Apart from the free SPAMfighter for home use, there are three business options: SPAMfighter Mail Gateway, which installs on Windows, SPAM fighter Hosted Mail Gateway, which is a SaaS version, and SPAMfighter Exchange Module, which is a special plug-in for Microsoft Exchange Server. You can access any of the business packages with a <a href="https://www.spamfighter.com/SPAMfighter/SMTP_Install.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-day free trial</a>.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>ORF Fusion is a server-side anti-spam solution that uses a multi-layered approach to identify and block spam. Besides spam filtering, it also offers detailed logging and reporting, making it ideal for compliance and internal monitoring. Additionally, it integrates well into existing email infrastructure.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: 23-layer Filtering System</b></h4>
      <p>A standout feature of ORF Fusion is its 23-layer filtering system. Every incoming email goes through these 23 filters, including DNS and SURBL blacklist evaluations, greylisting, keyword and content analysis, and more. Such an approach protects against a wide range of email threats.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ORF Fusion</strong> is a software package that runs on Windows. It is specifically designed to integrate with Exchange Server and IIS SMTP server. This tool operates through a blacklisting mechanism to which, over time, are added whitelisted addresses. The balance between acceptable and banned email addresses is interlinked with a series of other scans and checks on each arriving email.</p>
      <p>You can create your own whitelists to make sure that your trusted email senders aren’t put through spam filtering. The user also has control over what happens to those emails that are caught by the spam filter. For instance, you can bounce them to reject the transmission, keep the mail, or redirect it to a different mailbox.</p>

      <h4><b>Unique Business Proposition</b></h4>
      <p>Zerospam is a fully cloud-based solution that uses AI to identify a wide range of email-based threats, like spam, malware, ransomware, and more. It is also compatible with platforms like Microsoft 365 and Exchange, while deployment is simple and instant. Its user-friendly interface is another aspect that makes this tool ideal for all users.</p>
      <h4><b>Feature-in-Focus: AI and Machine Learning</b></h4>
      <p>ZeroSpam uses AI and machine learning to continuously learn and adapt to changing email threat patterns. These technologies also allow the tool to analyze large volumes of emails quickly and efficiently, reducing the false positive rate.</p>
      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Zerospam</strong> claims to block 98.99 percent of all spam. This could be due to an overzealous policy. However, the administrator will loosen the detection process over time. Some blocked emails might be valid and as you approve them, the system alters its blocking algorithm, which leads to a more accurate assessment for future emails.</p>
      <p>The tool will block <strong>Trojans</strong> and other <strong>malware</strong> in attachments and identify links to suspicious sites easily. However, identifying spam and phishing attempts is a lot more complicated. The Zerospam system uses a machine learning method to adapt its blocking system.</p>
      <p>The Zerospam policy requires administrator input in the first few weeks of operation. This can be time-consuming. However, it is the only way that a business can get a truly <strong>tailored</strong> spam filter that properly adapts to the regular pattern of email activity that the company expects to receive.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Zerospam offers a very reasonable price, which makes it appealing to businesses of all sizes. Its method of channeling all inbound emails means you save a lot of space on your own servers and infections won’t be able to get anywhere near your own system. This is a particularly good option for businesses that run virtual offices with a dispersed, home-based workforce.</p>
<p>Zerospam is based in Italy and the company sets its subscription price in Euros. This is 5 Euros ($5.44/£4.39) per month to cover five mailboxes or 10 Euros ($10.88/£8.78) per month to protect up to 1,000 mailboxes. There is also a <strong>Premium</strong> plan that adds on email archiving and costs 20 Euros ($21.76/£17.56) per month for 1,000 mailboxes. You can get a <a href="https://www.zerospam.eu/en/free-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-day free trial</a> to test the Zerospam system.</p>

          <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>ManageEngine ADManager Plus</strong>&nbsp;will read in all of your AD records and from then on, you use the ManageEngine system to run your access rights rather than Active Directory. The system automatically updates your AD domains behind the scenes.</p>
          <p>Customers of ManageEngine ADManager Plus have several implementation options. The software for the system can be downloaded and installed on <b>Windows Server</b>. It is also available for automated installation on an <b>Amazon AWS</b> account or on <b>Microsoft Azure</b>. If you choose the cloud services version, you can still manage all of your on-premises Active Directory instances with it.</p>
          <p>Your regular Active Directory management tasks, such as user accounts and groups management and device permissions creation can all be automated. This <b>coordinates new accounts</b> so you can pass them through to other instances. It will identify abandoned accounts and inactive devices to enable you to clean up the records in your AD instances.</p>
          <p>The ManageEngine service also helps you with <b>Active Directory administration tasks</b>, such as backup, restore, and replication.</p>
          <p>If your business needs to comply with specific data protection standards, such as <b>HIPAA</b> or <b>SOX</b>, you can indicate this in the settings of ADManager Plus and the system will be adjusted to ensure that you always remain in compliance. It also automatically produces all of the reports you need for those standards in the correct formats.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>Small businesses will appreciate the Free edition, which is limited to managing 100 AD objects. There are also two paid editions that cater to mid-sized, single-site companies, and large, multi-location enterprises. The software runs on Windows Server and the package is also available as a service on the AWS and Azure marketplaces.</p>
          <p>There are three editions of ADManager Plus: <b>Free</b>, <b>Standard</b>, and <b>Professional</b>. The Free edition is limited to managing one domain. The Standard version has a wider scope and the Professional edition includes the Help Desk modules.

           <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
           <p><strong>ManageEngine ADAudit Plus</strong> is a user behavior analytics tool that combats insider threats and account takeover opportunities. The system helps you tighten up Active Directory entries, for example by identifying abandoned accounts. It then logs the activities of each user for data loss prevention. The package also logs changes to AD records.</p>
           <p>ADAudit Plus doesn’t just operate on Active Directory. AD is the linchpin of the whole system but this is really an <b>activity tracking </b>service that particularly identifies the activities on sensitive data stores, so it is a data protection auditing tool that integrates Active Directory rather than being a system that audits Active Directory.</p>
           <p>The system records every login action and particularly <b>failed login attempts</b>, an excess of which could show account takeover attempts. The service also looks for sudden changes in behavior by a user in their access to different systems and particularly file storage. These unexpected changes in activities can also indicate <b>account takeover</b>.</p>
           <p>Other data protection measures in the ADAudit Plus package include a <b>file integrity monitor</b> (FIM), which encrypts sensitive files individually but automatically decrypts them for access by authorized users. The ADAudit Plus service also includes a removable storage media control system that can prevent copying to USBs.</p>
           <p>Clearly, analysis of the user accounts and permissions structure is part of the requirements for ADAudit Plus and the service also records all actions by administrators within the Active Directory environment. The log files that the service creates are also <b>protected against tampering</b>.</p>
           <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
           <p>This system is important for businesses that need to implement data protection standards. The package is good for compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and FISMA among other standards. There is a free edition of the package. However, this is only able to operate on data collected during the free trial of the full, paid package.</p>
           <p>The software for ADAudit Plus runs on <b>Windows Server</b>. Alternatively, you can get a cloud-hosted version on <b>Azure Marketplace</b> or <b>AWS Marketplace</b>. ManageEngine offers the system in three editions. The first of these is <b>Free</b>. Which logs activities on up to 25 workstations. The two paid editions are called <b>Standard</b> and <b>Professional</b>. The higher plan, Professional, adds on features such as GPO change tracking, “before and after” comparisons on AD changes, and account lockout analysis. You can assess ADAudit Plus with a fully functional <strong><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/go/manageengine-active-directory-admin-adap-ad-administration-management-tools/l/cta/u/8017-8765-2206-5792+337078/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1" data-postid="337078" data-clickid="8017-8765-2206-5792" class="go-link">30-day free trial</a></strong>.</p>

          <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>SolarWinds Access Rights Manager</strong> is designed to work with Active Directory. The service provides a new front end for your AD domains and it can front for multiple instances in one console. The tool provides a method for bulk actions, such as uploads and updates and it audits accounts to remove security weaknesses.</p>
          <p>The service analyzes the entries in AD and categorizes resources <b>according to sensitivity</b>. That identification allows for stronger protection measures for the more important assets. The system also tracks account usage and <b>identifies abandoned accounts</b> that need to be deleted.</p>
          <p>The SolarWinds system introduces a degree of <b>automation</b> that is not present in the native AD interface. It includes role-specific templates that quickly set up accounts in bulk. An alternative account management system is available through a self-service portal, which allows users to perform mundane account management functions, such as resetting passwords.</p>
          <p>The Access Rights Manager provides <b>insider threat analysis</b>. It performs a security assessment of device permissions and accounts group policies to highlight loose security and it recommends better account management strategies. A system of <b>role-specific account templates</b> helps you standardize provisioning and this can also be applied in bulk to existing accounts to tighten up security. System auditing and activity logging processes help you confirm optimal security settings.</p>
          <p>The SolarWinds system identifies the most important <b>log messages</b> coming out of Active Directory and it can manage their storage according to the requirements of data protection standards. The SolarWinds system also provides the constant activity monitoring required by those standards. It includes intrusion detection functions with <b>rapid account suspension abilities</b>.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This software package runs on Windows Server and if you are running Active Directory, you certainly will have that operating system on your site. The package can also manage Azure AD instances. The system is suitable for use by large organizations that have many AD domains.</p>

          <p><strong>Specops Active Directory Janitor</strong> is an auditor for Active Directory domains. IT will identify abandoned accounts and weak password security policies. The system also looks around your network to identify access systems that might not be managed within AD and advises to integrate their management with the Active Directory system.</p>
          <p>Other tools on this list give you everything you need for your Active Directory management duties in one console. Not everyone is comfortable with that strategy. Specops took a different approach and built <b>individual tools</b> for different AD administration tasks.</p>
          <p>This tool <b>scans the permissions structure</b> of AD and identifies loose security, dead accounts, and orphaned accounts. These scenarios are security risks because badly tracked and unused accounts provide convenient carriers for hackers. The tool produces a report and lets you decide how you can tidy up the system.</p>
          <p>This service includes <b>autodiscovery</b> functions, so it sets itself up. Not only does it scan through the AD database, but it searches the network to confirm the existence of listed devices. The automation features extend to automatic clean-up actions. However, you decide whether those processes will kick in automatically.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This tool is a good package for systems that have been badly managed. It provides a thorough assessment of access credential security and helps you bring all ARM issues into compliance. The system is also useful for ongoing checks but it will never come up with as many issues as it discovers on its first scan of your system.</p>

          <p><strong>Netwrix Auditor for Active Directory</strong> is a similar package to ManageEngine ADAudit Plus. It can be used to tune your ARM to specific standard requirements and then will produce compliance reporting. The tool tracks user actions, such as logon activity and failed logons. This will detect insider threats and account takeovers.</p>
          <p>This package focuses on the activity of administrators within the Active Directory environment. It reports on all login activity into Active Directory and <b>lists all changes</b> made. This doesn’t provide you with automated rollback of changes. However, it gives a record of alterations and if you didn’t make those changes, you know where to go to put things back to normal yourself.</p>
          <p>The system supervises a range of Active Directory implementations, including Azure AD, Microsoft Exchange Server, Windows 365, and the Windows File Server system.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This package will be particularly useful for businesses that need to comply with PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, GLBA, FISMA/NIST, and CJIS. Even if you don’t need to follow a particular standard, this tool is useful for user tracking and account protection. You will be able to identify abandoned accounts and see account activity that could be malicious.</p>
          <p>This is <b>a community-supported system</b>, which might be a problem if your corporate policy only allows you to deploy professionally supported software. However, don’t move on just yet because there is also <b>a paid version</b> of Netwrix Auditor for Active Directory and that is fully supported by the Netwrix Help Desk.</p>
          <p>The paid version has automatic tailoring to a list of <b>data security standards</b>. These include SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST, FERPA, GLBA, FISMA, CJIS, NERC CIP, and ISO/IEC 27001. This service also includes an interface for the backup and restore functions of Active Directory. The restore function can be triggered by accidental or malicious unauthorized changes to AD records.</p>

          <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>GroupID</strong> is a product of Imanami, which was recently taken over by Netwrix, so technically, this is the second Netwrix tool on our list. This is an Active Directory manager and focuses on the definition of user groups and mapping to teams. The system allows technicians to delegate the management of AD groups to the business managers who are in charge of each of the real-world teams that those groups represent.</p>
          <p>This system demonstrates all user accounts per group and also shows all device permissions, enabling <b>cross-management</b> of these two vital elements of Active Directory administration. The GroupID system shows you ways to create more groups so that you can implement a more finely nuanced access rights system.</p>
          <p>Many administrators are reluctant to create many user groups because it increases administration time. However, the clarity of the <b>management interface</b> offered by GroupID reduces that distraction, making it possible to manage a better grade of security policy.</p>
          <p>GroupID includes <b>automated onboarding routines</b> and systems to enable user accounts to change groups, which caters to scenarios where employees move to different positions within the organization. The tool integrates with an HR directory to improve role and permissions management.</p>
          <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
          <p>This service doesn’t cover all aspects of Active Directory administration and management, just the definition and maintenance of groups and the user accounts allocated to them. The ability to bring team managers into the task of managing domain records is a good idea because it removes communication errors between staff.</p>

        <p><strong>Adaxes</strong> is a management interface that will unify the administration of multiple domains. This is a similar service to that offered by ManageEngine ADManager Plus and SolarWinds Access Rights Manager. The service will provide a single console to manage Active Directory instances that could be on-premies, for Microsoft 365, for Exchange, or Azure AD.</p>
        <p>The Adaxes system not only supervises Active Directory, but it also has its own strategy for <b>optimizing role-based access control</b>. It examines the existing structure of your Active Directory environment and indicates where adjustments can be made to bring it into line with the Adaxes plan. So, this system provides you with a guided <b>Active Directory management strategy</b>.</p>
        <p>Moving on to day-to-day tasks and new user provisioning, Adaxes provides <b>workflows</b> for jobs and includes automated account creation services. Accounts are easy to adjust and delete as well.</p>
        <p>The console for this system is delivered from your own servers as a website and can be made available to any standard Web browser. The screens for the dashboard are customizable and they offer performance monitoring data as well as alerts for system security sweeps, access attempts, and unauthorized changes.</p>
        <p>Another web interface available to subscribing businesses is the <b>self-service portal</b>. This can be white-labeled and customized and it allows users to perform some of their access admin needs themselves. This reduces the load on your Help Desk team.</p>
        <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
        <p>This tool competes directly with its ManageEngine and SolarWinds rivals in the market for mid-sized and large businesses. The tool will coordinate replication and any changes you make to AD records through the Adazes interface get copied through to the backing Active directory instances.</p>
        <p>Adaxes installs on <b>Windows Server</b> and is sold on a perpetual license. Support contracts are written annually.

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><b>JSCAPE MFT </b>offers SFTP, FTPS, and SCP for secure transfers. It is also able to move files through HTTP, HTTPS, and WebDAV. The client for the file transfer utility is Web based and hosted together with the server. The client can be accessed by users who have been granted usage rights in the corporate access rights manager, which also provides file access authorization.</p>
  <p>The secure file transfer system is able to perform internal transfers and invite uploads or downloads for external users. The MFT package can also manage corporate syncing policy and organize local non-secure transfers, such as <b>TFTP</b> for network device configuration image movements.</p>
  <p>The JSCAPE package includes a plugin for Microsoft Outlook. This limits the files that can be accessed for attachments. For example, the tool can limit access to a specific folder. Another feature in the service is the ability to transfer <b>EDI</b> messages with AS2 and OFTP2.</p>
  <p>JSCAPE has created a fast file transfer system, called <b>Accelerated File Transfer Protocol </b>(AFTP). This isn’t a secure protocol but it can be used to move large files within the organization to a DMZ for distribution to outsiders.</p>

      <h4>Comparitech SupportScore</h4>
      <p>While the company’s products are well-respected, Files.com’s size may limit its ability to provide a rapid, hands-on product support for every customer. There may be self-support documentation available to customers, but this is not visibly available to non-customers. These limitations resulted in Files.com receiving a <strong>60/100 SupportScore.&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Note that this is not a reflection of Files.com as a product. We continue to find Files.com provides a solid SFTP service, but it may be better suited to companies that have adequate technical skills among their IT teams without much need of extra support to launch and maintain their software implementation.</p>
      <p>Be aware that you may have longer wait times to troubleshoot potential issues. If you are shortlisting Files.com as your vendor, we recommend asking specifically about its customer and product support to verify if this is a good fit for your needs.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p>The <strong>Files.com</strong> service encourages you to upload files onto the provider’s cloud platform and email out links instead of sending out copies. The advantage of this strategy is that it allows your company and each individual user to maintain control over how those files can be accessed and revoking permissions means that the former recipient doesn’t get to keep a copy of the file. All transfers, storage, and viewing are protected by encryption.</p>
  <div class="jsx-524183946 diff-row" tabindex="0" role="row" data-index="2" data-known-size="48" data-item-index="2"><strong><span class="jsx-2685123126 diff-chunk diff-chunk-equal">Files.com <span class="jsx-2685123126 diff-chunk diff-chunk-inserted">can operate with FTP and SFTP in three different ways.</span></span></strong></div>
  <div class="jsx-524183946 diff-row" tabindex="0" role="row" data-index="8" data-known-size="160" data-item-index="8">
<p>Files.com itself can operate as an inbound FTP and SFTP server, allowing you and your users to connect to your Files.com account via SFTP. This allows you to use SFTP to access any portion of your Files.com account, even folders that are syncing to other providers, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Box, Dropbox, Wasabi, etc.</p>
<p>You can Mount an external FTP or SFTP site directly into Files.com as a folder. Files.com acts as an FTP or SFTP Client in this context, making that SFTP site available via the Files.com web interface, API, SDKs, and even other inbound SFTP connections.</p>
<p>You can configure a scheduled Sync, where Files.com will synchronize its copy of a folder or folders on a one-way or two-way basis with the external FTP or SFTP server.</p>
</div>
<p>Businesses can use Files.com as a pass-through when sending files to outsiders, storing a backup on the server in case of loss. It can also be used as a <b>collaboration file storage</b> – enabling several users to access and edit a document. Given that files can be left on the Files.com server, it can also be used as <b>a backup service</b> for important system files.</p>
<p>Files.com supports Single Sign On (SSO), Two Factor Authentication (2FA), Data Locality, Data Retention Management, Management Delegation, Audit Trails, Non-Repudiation, HIPAA, GDPR, and everything else needed for a secure and compliant Cloud Managed File Transfer solution.</p>
<p>The security offered by Files.com enhances transfer protocols because it enforces <b>two-factor authentication</b> for file access and uses the typical SFTP -strength protection for files during transmission.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Although there is a requirement for a minimum number of user accounts, which is five, the per-user charging of Files.com is a very scaleable service that is accessible to businesses of all sizes.

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ExaVault</strong> is a very similar service to Files.com and you will have trouble devising between the two. Both offer secure transfers and storage and promote discretionary file sharing. The tools also both include an integration with Microsoft 365. In the field of workflow automation, both systems can be used with Zapier to create third-party orchestration with other applications.</p>
      <p>The ExaVault service is flexible and it can be put to a range of uses. You can use ExaVault with any secure <b>FTP client</b> and activate process automation features in the platform to create flow through for authorized transfers. The system can also be used as a primary store of business documents because it promotes <b>collaboration</b> through a file sharing mechanism. The service is offered in packages that provide different volumes of <b>cloud storage space</b>.</p>
      <p>Employees can cut network and internet traffic by uploading a file for <b>distribution</b> and then emailing out links to the file instead of transferring many copies. The link access system provides stronger permission controls and also includes activity tracking.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p>This system is a high-end tool and not just a file transfer tool. The package includes both a server and a client, which are hosted together – users access the client remotely. The <b>Cerberus FTP Server</b> offers many more protocol options than just SFTP and FTPS and it can implement automated transfers.</p>
  <p>The Cerberus FTP Server system offers a <b>secure environment</b>. Users need to log in to use the client and credentials are validated against <b>Active Directory</b>. It is also possible to implement a single sign-on environment by connecting to <b>Okta</b>.</p>
  <p>There are <b>three plans</b> for the Cerberus package and higher editions, while being more expensive, provide more features. The top plan includes a performance monitoring service and also automated network monitoring. This service can identify rogue transfers. All plans include activity logging.</p>
  <p>As well as user access, the tool offers opportunities for <b>task automation</b>. It is possible to set up virtual folders and group directories, which open up the options for file sharing and automated file transfers. The FTP server can be used to back up file download features in websites and it can also receive files uploaded through a Web interface.</p>

      <h4><b>Why do we recommend it?</b></h4>
      <p>SFTP To Go is easy to use, as you can transfer and share files through its intuitive web portal. There are no complicated processes involved, making it ideal for all users, regardless of their technical knowledge.</p>
      <p>One of the highlights of SFTP To Go is its focus on security. It offers two kinds of authentication – accounts and credentials. Accounts are members of an organization who are authorized to perform certain activities on a file. This access is controlled at the organizational level. Credentials, on the other hand, are used to perform authorized activities alone on a file. These credentials can be for a specified time only. Such secure features reduce the chances of unauthorized access.</p>

Under that section, the left column shows<b> local files and directories</b>, and the right column<b> displays files and directories on the server </b>you’re connected to. Being able to compare the two side-by-side makes it easier to know what transfers you need to complete.</p>
  <p><b>Drag-and-drop</b> allows you to add files into <b>FileZilla</b> to transfer. You can<b> view a list of files being transferred </b>in the<b> Queued files </b>section at the bottom of the screen. If you want to cap the number of transfers taking place then you can<b> configure transfer speed limits</b>.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server</strong> is a great choice, above all because it is free. Many free tools are not very good but this one comes from SolarWinds, which is a trusted and well-supported provider. This tool also enforces user credentials for access and provides strong encryption, so it is suitable for use on maintenance tasks that might include the transfer of mission-critical settings. It can also be used to protect the transfers of sensitive files up to 4 GB in size.</p>
  <p>To control access to your files, you can <b>create user accounts</b>. Configuring user authentication details lets you determine who can access your files. You can add new users by entering a <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> in the <b>Users</b> section. The process is simple, so it’s easy for new users to start managing employee access to the server.</p>
  <p>If you want additional security, then you can limit the operations that are permitted on the server. You can select a list of operations that the server will allow including <b>Upload File, Download File, Delete File, Rename File, List Directory Contents, Create Directory, Delete Directory,</b> and more. You can also choose what protocols you will allow.</p>
  <p>SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server provides you with everything you need to start managing SFTP and SCP file transfers with a simple user interface.</p>
  <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
  <p>This secure file transfer system can have many applications. However, you will find that this is the utility that you have been looking for to distribute configuration files to remote devices. The system can be used as a secure replacement for TFTP when updating firmware on IoT devices and the system is able to interface with iOS.</p>
  <p>During our testing, we identified the following pros and cons related to SFTP/SCP.</p>
  <p>Buyers of the <b>SolarWinds Engineer’s Toolset</b> won’t need to download this free SFTP/SCP Server because it is already bundled into the package. The Engineer’s Toolset includes more than 60 network administration utilities, such as a <b>Configuration Manager</b> and an I<b>P Address Manager</b>. This package is available for a <strong><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/free-sftp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">14-day free trial</a></strong>.</p>
  <div class="ctech-content-on-bk  "><p></p>
<p><strong>SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server</strong> offers a complete SFTP solution that can fully support most enterprises. The multiple file transfers offered by the tool and the 4GB limit is more than ample to get you started.</p>
<p>While the software doesn’t have a fancy GUI or tons of bells and whistles, this is an advantage for new users, because it makes the system easier to navigate. SolarWinds SFTP/SCP Server is only available for Windows.</p>

      <p>Our analysis of this company resulted in a <strong>SupportScore of 21/100.</strong> Syncplify clean look and feel make the company appear bigger than it is. However, it’s small size will likely result in limited 1-on-1 customer support. If your businesses needs product onboarding, implementation help, or ongoing and regular support, you may not be well-served here.</p>
      <p>That is note a mark against the company’s product. As Syncplify grows, this may change. For now, this tool is best for companies with highly skilled IT teams that can take full advantage of Syncplify’s broad self-service documentation.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p>The HIPAA-compliant <strong>Syncplify Server</strong> is a useful tool for secure transfers of sensitive data. You can also use this system to receive a large number of files simultaneously, which means that it is an ideal system for large organizations that regularly expect files from members of the public of a business association. The concurrent file transfer limit of 5,000 goes far beyond the requirements of a single business for internal use.</p>
  <p>One of the features that makes<b> Syncplify Server</b> stand apart from many other competitors is its extensibility. You can <b>create custom scripts</b> to add new functions. Scripts give you complete control over the file management process enabling better integration with your daily operations.</p>

      <h4>Comparitech SupportScore</h4>
      <p>CrushFTP is one of the smallest FTP software providers on our list. As such, this company earned <strong>15/100 SupportScore</strong> in our analysis of its customer and product support capabilities. While this is not an indication or poor product quality, it does mean that you may need to operate this software independently without the assistance or support of CrushFTP should you run into issues.</p>
      <p>The company supplements this with a large amount of self-service documentation, which could be exactly what your company needs. If not, we recommend going with a larger provider. Nevertheless, if possible, contact someone at CrushFTP to learn more about how it provides support to existing customers.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>CrushFTP</strong> is a cross between the mediated file transfer platforms such as Files.com and ExaVault, and managed file transfer systems, such as SolarWinds Serv-U. This hosted service lets you create interface forms that validate users and allow self-service of files. It also enables you to create access to files through a Web-based viewer that eliminates the need for the transfer of data.</p>
  <p>To manage user access, you can <b>create custom forms for users</b> when they visit your site. For example, you can ask for additional information about file uploads. Users also have the option to retain control over files or files and enable others to have temporary access. <b>Temporary access</b> can be <b>sent out via email </b>and remains available for a specific time period. However, administrators can still step in to control the type of content that can be shared and for the amount of time if needed.</p>
  <p>For security, CrushFTP includes<b> automated banning</b>. CrushFTP monitors connection patterns and<b> bans IPs that hammer connection, command, or password settings</b>. Blocking malicious IPs reduces your exposure to bad actors and stops them from interacting with your server.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>Rebex Tiny SFTP Server</strong> is a free tool. It is a lightweight and secure file transfer utility that is ideal for securing the movements of small files. As the name suggests, this is a secure replacement for the Tiny File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), which is usually used for transferring configuration files to network and IoT devices.</p>

<p>The tool is ideal for enterprises that need a simple SFTP solution rather than a complete SFTP server. While Rebex Tiny SFTP Server is an excellent tool it is important to note that it stores passwords in cleartext.</p>
<p>That means you can see passwords on the main server form, making Rebex Tiny SFTP Server inappropriate for users looking for a secure solution. It’s free for personal and commercial use. You can <a href="https://www.rebex.net/tiny-sftp-server/#download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gtm-vis-has-fired1649924_55="1">download the software for free</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Network administrators are probably using TFTP to move configuration images at the moment and should replace that facility with Rebex Tiny SFTP Server. The time has gone when network administrators could rely on the security of a private network. You should ensure strong file encryption on all of your file movements even within the confines of your LAN.</p>
<p>During our testing, we identified the following pros and cons related to Rebex Tiny SFTP Server.</p>
<div class="ctech-content-on-bk  "><p></p>
<p><b>Rebex Tiny SFTP Server </b>is a great lightweight SFTP server. If you want to conduct quick transfers without worrying about completing any hefty installations or configurations then this is the tool to use.</p>
<p>However, if you want to transfer sensitive information then the plain text disclosure of passwords is likely to be a deal-breaker. Rebex Tiny SFTP Server is available for Windows.</p>

  <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>ManageEngine ADManager Plus</strong> offers a more useable interface for Active Directory management that the native AD administration screens. Once you start up this tool, you won’t need to access the basic AD screens again because ManageEngine flows through all actions that you perform in the ADManager Plus screens to the Active Directory system.</p>
  <p>With regards to reports, <b>ManageEngine ADManager Plus </b>can be used to automate the report generation process. This means that you can generate reports without having to do everything manually. This not only makes Active Directory management more convenient but also reduces the time that would be wasted on navigating the Active Directory program.</p>
  <p>It is also worth mentioning that <strong>ManageEngine ADManager Plus</strong> is a tool you should consider for regulatory compliance as well. If you need to complete a compliance audit for SOX or HIPAA, the ability to manage your Active Directory data and generate reports is invaluable.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><b>NinjaOne</b> provides Active Directory management within its main console. This means that technicians don’t need to log in remotely to each AD domain. Functions within the tool enable password resets, user account permissions changes, enabling and disabling of accounts, password policy enforcement, and group allocation. The AD management system is included in the price of the RMM package.</p>
<p>During testing, NinjaOne Endpoint Management provided high visibility into the health and performance of an organization’s Active Directory Domain Controllers (ADDCs), alongside all other managed devices. NinjaOne automatically detected if a server was a primary or secondary domain controller and managed to pull in AD user data which made for more efficient, single-pane management. NinjaOne enabled our admins to quickly and easily access the complete list of ADDC user accounts, see details on each account, and take necessary actions (i.e., disable account, unlock user, reset password, etc.) without having to remote into a device.</p>

<p>The full NinjaOne service gives technicians <b>automated monitoring</b> services for remote systems with alerts for performance problems. This means that it isn’t necessary to allocate a technician to watch the system monitoring screens because staff will be drawn to the service by a notification if they are needed. This feature enables a small team of technicians to monitor many systems simultaneously.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><b>SentinelOne Singularity Ranger AD</b> is a remnant of a wider security package from SentinelOne that was called Ranger Pro. This is the only part of the Ranger range that is still available. It audits Active Directory domains and checks for risk factors, such as abandoned accounts and flabby password policies.</p>
<p>The SentinelOne system can be run on your own server, sitting alongside Active Directory on <b>Windows Server</b>. You can also opt to get it as a SaaS package on the SentinelOne cloud system. In either configuration, you can use the tool to monitor Active Directory on premise and Azure AD in the cloud.</p>
<p>The auditing functions of Ranger AD operate continuously, which makes it a vulnerability analysis service. The live cycle also tracks the activities of each account in the AD list. This includes factors such as elevated privileges, used for accessing the settings of infrastructure. The monitoring cycle extends to attack monitoring.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Ranger AD is both a preventative security system and a live attack monitoring service. The package can be used as part of an account takeover or insider threat analysis system. The tool is reasonably priced and is suitable for use by any size or type of company that deploys Active Directory for its access rights manager.</p>
<p>SentinelOne Singularity Ranger AD offers good value for money because it provides both account auditing services and live attack monitoring.

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Specops Command</strong> provides a scripting system to manage users and devices. This is a great maintenance task automation feature that can implement tasks overnight when all of the users are out of the office.</p>
<p>What makes the scripting feature interesting is that you can not only write your own scripts but import them straight from a file as well. In addition, you can schedule when a script will be executed. This gives you an additional measure of automation that allows you to take a step back.</p>
<p>Not wanting to be a one trick pony, <strong>SpecOps Command </strong>also allows you to <strong>generate reports</strong> as well. These reports are web-based and designed around script feedback. The advantage here is you can take extra time to analyze the feedback from what you’ve done.</p>

      <p>While thorough, this analysis only examines customer support based on external signals. We recommend you discuss this topic in more detail with Quest if you choose to shortlist it.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Recovery Manager for Active Directory</strong> is a backup system for AD. This tool is able to provide object-level recovery, restoring depleted or altered objects while the system is still active.</p>
<p>With <b>Recovery Manager for Active Directory</b> you can <b>restore objects such as users</b>, <b>computers</b>, <b>attributes</b>, <b>configurations</b>, <b>sites</b>, <b>subnets, group policy objects</b>, and <b>organizational units</b>. In other words, if you lose something you can recover it.</p>
<p>The advantage of this is far beyond convenience. By allowing you to recover without restarting, your service stays online and any damage done to your service is minimized. Whether the system fails due to a security event or a fault you can get the recovery process started immediately. There is also a reporting process that highlights any changes that have taken place since the last backup. This helps you to see if any undesirable changes have taken place.</p>

<p>However this isn’t all, as <strong>Recovery Manager for Active Directory </strong>also offers you <strong>Hybrid</strong> and<strong> Azure Active Directory Recovery</strong> as well. This means you have a wide coverage of basic network infrastructure as much as off-premises services.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Any business that uses Active Directory for its access rights management system needs to ensure consent availability and integrity of their user access authentication processes and so a recovery manager for AD is essential.</p>
<p>The only issue with the <b>Recovery Manager for Active Directory</b> is that its pricing is not transparent.

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>ManageEngine Free Active Directory Tools</strong> is a pack of 14 utilities to manage AD instances. The group of tools is free to use and includes activity reports that can be exported in CSV files to be examined by third-party tools.</p>
      <p>All of these utilities have the focus of making it easier to manage Active Directory. For example, there is a <b>Free Password Expiry Notifier</b> <b>utility </b>that <b>reminds users to update their passwords via email or SMS</b>. Similarly, the Duplicates Identifier allows you to see all duplicated objects in one click. The result is an <b>Active Directory </b>administrative experience that is more versatile than <b>Active Directory</b> alone.</p>
      <p>Another interesting utility is the <strong>Terminal Session Manager</strong>. <strong>With the Terminal Session Manager the user can utilize a PowerShell cmdlet to find and manage a range of terminal sessions from a centralized location</strong>. This is particularly useful because it allows you to manage and disconnect multiple users from one location.</p>

<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>Any system administrator that relies on Active Directory for the corporate access rights management service would benefit from having these fee tools to hand. The package includes tools that would be of more interest to network managers, such as the DMZ Port Analyzer.</p>
<p>The <strong>ManageEngine Free Active Directory Tools </strong>bundle is well worth considering if you’re looking to add a range of new Active Directory functions to your tricks bag. One of the best things about this is that you won’t have to pay for the privilege of these utilities either because <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/products/free-windows-active-directory-tools/free-active-directory-tools-index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything is free to download</a>.</p>

      <p>It’s score may seem low for such a well-known company, but this is a reflection of its decidedly low employee job satisfaction scores. Low job satisfaction among employees may impact the quality of service you get, which could result in a poor customer experience.</p>

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner</strong> supports the issue that creates the largest number of calls to an IT Help Desk – account lockout. The most frequent cause of lockout is a forgotten password. However, the lockout mechanism is there to block password-cracking attempts, so, with this tool, you can identify which lockouts are caused by forgetfulness and which show an account is under attack.</p>
<p>You can use <b>Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner</b> to ascertain why the user has been locked out with relative ease. Whether it’s on account of a disconnected desktop or a task obscuring the service you will be able to tell. This allows you to tell if you need to take further action or if it’s a temporary blip.</p>
<p>Once an administrator has seen that an account has been locked out they can unlock that account through the centralized console or a mobile device. This enables the user to get user accounts unlocked ASAP. As a consequence, normal service can be resumed much quicker than it would be trying to go it alone with <strong>Active Directory</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The account lockout tool is a big timesaver for IT support teams. Any business of any size would benefit from this tool because it is completely free to use.</p>
<p><strong>Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner</strong> is a tool that provides a solid account monitoring experience.

<h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bulk Password Control</strong> is a free tool that enables an administrator to perform bulk actions on AD user account passwords, such as bulk password resets. One problem with this service is that it tempts administrators to set passwords for all accounts to the same value, which could be a big security weakness for infrequently used accounts where the user is unlikely to log in and set a new password.</p>
<p>However you aren’t limited to resetting passwords for user accounts either; you can also unlock, enable or disable user accounts as well. This gives you a high degree of control over your active directory users and computers so that if you need to restructure or remove an unsuitable account you can do so with ease.</p>
<h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
<p>The bulk password management system is a great tool for any business. However, it needs to be used with caution. The tool is free to use, so even small businesses with tight budgets can get access to it. The password generator is a useful tool to avoid populating all accounts with easily-guessable passwords.</p>
<p>The bulk password management ability of this product makes it ideal for larger enterprise environments with lots of different users and accounts. <strong>Bulk Password Control</strong> can be <a href="http://www.wisesoft.co.uk/software/passwordcontrol/bulk_password_control.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloaded for free</a>.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why do we recommend it?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Netwrix Inactive User Tracker</strong> is another free tool that any administrator needs to have. This is a good service for tightening security because abandoned accounts are a major avenue of entry for hackers.</p>
      <p>Once you can see that an account has been inactive for a substantial length of time you can deactivate it. Deactivating inactive accounts will reduce the risk of a malicious entity gaining access to your data. Likewise, it will also help if you are audited because it shows that you are taking a proactive approach towards cybersecurity and record management.</p>
      <h4><strong>Who is it recommended for?</strong></h4>
      <p>Businesses of all sizes will enjoy this tool because it is free to use. It is able to identify accounts that suddenly have activity after a period of being dormant, which could indicate account takeover.</p>
      <p><strong>Netwrix Inactive User Tracker</strong> is a tool that is worth its weight in gold for those moments where you need to clean up your <strong>Active Directory</strong> accounts. Doing this regularly will not only get rid of records you don’t need but will also eliminate vulnerable accounts that can be accessed for malicious purposes. <strong>Netwrix Inactive User Tracker</strong> can be <a href="https://www.netwrix.com/netwrix_inactive_user_tracker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloaded for free</a>.</p>
